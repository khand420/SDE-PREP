- **Defect Ticket 4436**: The first three issues reported in this defect ticket remain unresolved. The team member is urged to conduct thorough testing of the script to address these issues effectively.
- **Permission Denied Error**: During the execution of a bash script, a permission denied error was encountered, indicating potential issues with file access or permissions that need to be resolved.
- **Ticket Management**: The ticket associated with the script (ticket 4281) has been moved back to "in-progress," suggesting that further work is required before it can be closed.
- **Collaboration**: The conversation emphasizes the importance of collaboration and communication within the team, with requests for validation of reports and clarification on defects.

### Conclusion
The conversation underscores the need for additional testing and resolution of existing issues related to the script. It highlights the collaborative effort required to address defects and improve the overall functionality of the project.




### Overview
The document outlines a project aimed at enhancing the monitoring of file counts in HDFS. It describes the need for automated alerts when file counts exceed specified thresholds, improving proactive management of data ingestion processes.

### image.png
- **Context**: The document highlights a problem where spikes in incoming data volume can lead to increased file counts on HDFS, especially when certain jobs fail. Currently, these issues are only detected through manual checks.
- **Goal**: The primary objective is to implement an automated email alert system that triggers when file counts for a day or month exceed certain thresholds. This will help in timely intervention without manual oversight.
- **Enhancements**: The existing daily file count report from EIDAT-4281 will be improved to provide better formatting and breakdown of metrics. This includes storing metrics in a database for easier access and management.
- **Acceptance Criteria (A/C)**:
  - An automated email alert system should be established, which is configurable regarding thresholds for file counts on HDFS.
  - The content of the alert email should include critical information such as the timestamp of the report, actual file counts, and the respective thresholds.

### Conclusion
The proposed enhancements aim to streamline the monitoring of file counts in HDFS, ensuring that issues are addressed proactively through automated alerts. This will reduce the reliance on manual checks and improve overall data management efficiency.





To implement the automated alert system for monitoring HDFS file counts in Python, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can use `pip` to install them:

```bash
pip install smtplib pandas
```

### Step 2: Define Configuration Parameters
Create a configuration file or use environment variables to store your threshold values and email settings.

```python
import os

# Example configuration
THRESHOLD_DAILY = 1000  # Set your threshold for daily file count
THRESHOLD_MONTHLY = 30000  # Set your threshold for monthly file count
EMAIL_SENDER = os.getenv("EMAIL_SENDER")
EMAIL_RECEIVER = os.getenv("EMAIL_RECEIVER")
EMAIL_PASSWORD = os.getenv("EMAIL_PASSWORD")
```

### Step 3: Function to Check File Counts
Create a function to check the file counts on HDFS. You might need to use a library like `pydoop` or `hdfs` to interact with HDFS.

```python
import pandas as pd

def get_hdfs_file_count(path):
    # Placeholder function to get file count from HDFS
    # Replace with actual logic to fetch file count from HDFS
    return len(pd.read_csv(path))  # Example using a CSV file for demo
```

### Step 4: Send Email Alerts
Create a function to send email alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_email_alert(subject, body):
    msg = MIMEText(body)
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    msg['From'] = EMAIL_SENDER
    msg['To'] = EMAIL_RECEIVER

    with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) as server:
        server.starttls()
        server.login(EMAIL_SENDER, EMAIL_PASSWORD)
        server.send_message(msg)
```

### Step 5: Main Logic
Combine everything in a main function that checks file counts and sends alerts if thresholds are exceeded.

```python
def main():
    daily_file_count = get_hdfs_file_count('path/to/daily/file/counts.csv')  # Example path
    monthly_file_count = get_hdfs_file_count('path/to/monthly/file/counts.csv')  # Example path

    if daily_file_count > THRESHOLD_DAILY:
        send_email_alert(
            "Daily File Count Alert",
            f"Daily file count exceeded: {daily_file_count} files."
        )

    if monthly_file_count > THRESHOLD_MONTHLY:
        send_email_alert(
            "Monthly File Count Alert",
            f"Monthly file count exceeded: {monthly_file_count} files."
        )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Step 6: Schedule the Script
Use a task scheduler (like `cron` on Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows) to run this script at regular intervals (daily or monthly).

### Conclusion
This implementation allows you to monitor HDFS file counts and receive email alerts if they exceed specified thresholds. Make sure to adapt the HDFS file count retrieval logic based on your actual data source and requirements.
