DataFrame df with columns ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']. Write a function to:
Filter rows where column A is greater than 5.
Group the filtered rows by column B and calculate the mean of column C.
Add a new column E that contains the cumulative sum of column D





Certainly! Here’s how to solve the problem using Pandas, Django, and MySQL.

### 1. Using Pandas

Here’s a function that performs the required operations on a Pandas DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd

def process_dataframe(df):
    # Filter rows where column A is greater than 5
    filtered_df = df[df['A'] > 5]
    
    # Group by column B and calculate mean of column C
    grouped_df = filtered_df.groupby('B', as_index=False)['C'].mean()
    
    # Add a new column E that contains the cumulative sum of column D
    grouped_df['E'] = filtered_df['D'].cumsum()
    
    return grouped_df
```

### 2. Using Django with MySQL

Assuming you have a Django model set up for your DataFrame, here’s how to implement the same logic in a Django view:

#### Model Definition (in `models.py`)

```python
from django.db import models

class MyData(models.Model):
    A = models.FloatField()
    B = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    C = models.FloatField()
    D = models.FloatField()
```

#### Function in Views (in `views.py`)

```python
from django.db.models import Avg, Sum
from .models import MyData

def process_data():
    # Filter rows where column A is greater than 5
    filtered_data = MyData.objects.filter(A__gt=5)
    
    # Group by column B and calculate mean of column C
    grouped_data = filtered_data.values('B').annotate(mean_C=Avg('C'))
    
    # Calculate cumulative sum of column D
    cumulative_sum = 0
    for record in grouped_data:
        cumulative_sum += MyData.objects.filter(A__gt=5, B=record['B']).aggregate(Sum('D'))['D__sum']
        record['E'] = cumulative_sum

    return grouped_data
```

### 3. Using MySQL

You can achieve the same result directly in MySQL with the following query:

```sql
SELECT 
    B,
    AVG(C) AS mean_C,
    @cumulative_sum := @cumulative_sum + D AS E
FROM 
    (SELECT A, B, C, D FROM my_data WHERE A > 5) AS filtered_data,
    (SELECT @cumulative_sum := 0) AS init
GROUP BY 
    B
ORDER BY 
    B;
```

### Explanation

1. **Pandas**:
   - The function filters the DataFrame for rows where column A is greater than 5.
   - It groups the filtered DataFrame by column B and calculates the mean of column C.
   - A new column E is added, which contains the cumulative sum of column D.

2. **Django**:
   - In the Django model, we define a model for the data.
   - The function filters the data, groups it by column B, and calculates the mean of C.
   - It then calculates the cumulative sum of D for each group.

3. **MySQL**:
   - The SQL query filters the data, groups by column B, calculates the average of C, and computes the cumulative sum of D using a user-defined variable.

### Complete Example in MySQL

If you want to create the table, insert data, and run the query, here’s a complete example:

```sql
-- Create the table
CREATE TABLE my_data (
    A INT,
    B VARCHAR(255),
    C FLOAT,
    D FLOAT
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO my_data (A, B, C, D) VALUES
(6, 'X', 10, 5),
(7, 'Y', 20, 10),
(8, 'X', 30, 15),
(4, 'Y', 40, 20),
(9, 'Z', 50, 25);

-- Run the query
SELECT 
    B,
    AVG(C) AS mean_C,
    @cumulative_sum := @cumulative_sum + D AS E
FROM 
    (SELECT A, B, C, D FROM my_data WHERE A > 5) AS filtered_data,
    (SELECT @cumulative_sum := 0) AS init
GROUP BY 
    B
ORDER BY 
    B;
```

This will provide you with the required results across all three platforms: Pandas, Django, and MySQL.
