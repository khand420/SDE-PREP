Explain the difference between threading, multiprocessing, and asyncio.

Threading: Suitable for I/O-bound tasks. Multiple threads can run concurrently but are limited by the GIL.
Multiprocessing: Suitable for CPU-bound tasks. Multiple processes can run in parallel, bypassing the GIL.
Asyncio: Suitable for I/O-bound tasks that require high concurrency. Uses event loops to handle asynchronous operations without threading.




Certainly! Here are concise answers to each of the questions:

### 1. **Recursion**

   - **Factorial Calculation:**
     ```python
     def factorial(n):
         if n == 0:
             return 1
         return n * factorial(n - 1)
     ```

   - **Fibonacci Series:**
     ```python
     def fibonacci(n):
         if n <= 1:
             return n
         return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
     ```

   - **Binary Search:**
     ```python
     def binary_search(arr, target, low, high):
         if low > high:
             return -1
         mid = (low + high) // 2
         if arr[mid] == target:
             return mid
         elif arr[mid] < target:
             return binary_search(arr, target, mid + 1, high)
         else:
             return binary_search(arr, target, low, mid - 1)
     ```

   - **String Reversal:**
     ```python
     def reverse_string(s):
         if len(s) == 0:
             return s
         return reverse_string(s[1:]) + s[0]
     ```

   - **Tower of Hanoi:**
     ```python
     def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
         if n == 1:
             print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
             return
         tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)
         print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")
         tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)
     ```

### 2. **Django REST API**

   - **Viewsets vs. Views:**
     - **Viewsets**: Provide CRUD operations for models with less code. They use routers to automatically handle URLs.
     - **Views**: Offer more flexibility but require manually defining routes and handling HTTP methods.

   - **Serialization:**
     ```python
     from rest_framework import serializers
     from .models import MyModel

     class MyModelSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
         class Meta:
             model = MyModel
             fields = '__all__'
     ```

   - **JWT Authentication:**
     - Install `djangorestframework-simplejwt`.
     - In `settings.py`:
       ```python
       REST_FRAMEWORK = {
           'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
               'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
           ),
       }
       ```

   - **Authorization and Permissions:**
     ```python
     from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated

     class MyViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
         permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
     ```

   - **Throttling:**
     ```python
     from rest_framework.throttling import UserRateThrottle

     class MyThrottle(UserRateThrottle):
         rate = '5/minute'
     ```

### 3. **Authentication and Authorization**

   - **Authentication vs. Authorization:**
     - **Authentication**: Verifies who you are.
     - **Authorization**: Determines what you can do.

   - **Token-Based Authentication:** Tokens are issued to clients upon login and are used for subsequent requests to verify identity.

   - **OAuth2:** A framework that allows third-party applications to access a user's resources without exposing credentials. Roles: 
     - **Client**: Requests access.
     - **Resource Server**: Hosts the resources.
     - **Authorization Server**: Issues tokens.

   - **RBAC in Django:**
     ```python
     from django.contrib.auth.models import User, Group
     
     def assign_role(user, role_name):
         role, created = Group.objects.get_or_create(name=role_name)
         user.groups.add(role)
     ```

   - **User Model Customization:**
     ```python
     from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

     class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
         birthday = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
     ```

### 4. **HTTP vs. HTTPS**

   - **HTTP vs. HTTPS:** HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data between the client and server, providing secure communication.

   - **SSL/TLS:** Encrypts data, ensuring secure communication. SSL has been succeeded by TLS.

   - **SSL Certificate:** A digital certificate that authenticates a website's identity and enables an encrypted connection.

   - **HTTP Status Codes:** 
     - `200 OK`: Request succeeded.
     - `404 Not Found`: Resource not found.
     - `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error.

   - **CORS Issues:** Configure CORS settings in Django using the `django-cors-headers` package.

### 5. **TLS/SSL**

   - **SSL vs. TLS:** TLS is a more secure and updated version of SSL. SSL is deprecated.

   - **Handshake Process:** Establishes a secure connection by agreeing on encryption algorithms and exchanging keys.

   - **Certificate Authorities (CAs):** Issue and manage SSL/TLS certificates.

   - **HTTPS Setup with Nginx:**
     - Configure SSL certificate paths in `nginx.conf`.
     ```nginx
     server {
         listen 443 ssl;
         ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
         ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;
         ...
     }
     ```

### 6. **Deployment (Nginx and Gunicorn)**

   - **Gunicorn:** A WSGI HTTP server for Python web applications. It handles requests and forwards them to Django.
     - Example configuration: `gunicorn myproject.wsgi:application`

   - **Nginx:** Acts as a reverse proxy server, forwarding requests to Gunicorn and serving static files.
     - Example configuration:
       ```nginx
       server {
           listen 80;
           server_name mydomain.com;
           
           location / {
               proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
               proxy_set_header Host $host;
               proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
               proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
               proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
           }
       }
       ```

   - **Deployment Steps:**
     1. Configure Gunicorn.
     2. Set up Nginx to forward requests to Gunicorn.
     3. Set up a PostgreSQL database.
     4. Configure Django settings for production (e.g., DEBUG=False).

   - **Serving Static Files:** Configure Nginx to serve static files directly from a directory.

   - **Load Balancing:** Use Nginx to distribute incoming traffic among multiple Gunicorn instances.

### 7. **SQL and ACID Properties**

   - **ACID Properties:**
     - **Atomicity:** Transactions are all-or-nothing.
     - **Consistency:** Database state is consistent before and after a transaction.
     - **Isolation:** Transactions are isolated from each other.
     - **Durability:** Changes are permanent once committed.

   - **Normalization:** Process of organizing database schema to reduce redundancy. Normal forms ensure that the database is structured properly.

   - **Joins:**
     - **INNER JOIN:** Returns rows with matching values in both tables.
     - **LEFT JOIN:** Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table.
     - **RIGHT JOIN:** Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table.
     - **FULL OUTER JOIN:** Returns rows with matches in either table.

   - **Indexes:** Improve query performance by allowing quick data retrieval.

   - **Transactions:** Use `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` to manage transactions:
     ```sql
     BEGIN;
     -- SQL operations
     COMMIT;
     -- or ROLLBACK;
     ```
