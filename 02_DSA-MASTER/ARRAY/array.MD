## 🧠 Arrays & Hashing: Prefix Sum, Frequencies, Sliding Window

### **Prefix Sum**

The Prefix Sum technique involves preprocessing an array to create a new array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the array from the start up to `i`. This allows for efficient sum queries on subarrays.([blog.algomaster.io][1])

**Easy:**

* Find the sum of elements between two indices.
* Find the equilibrium index.
* Calculate the mean of a range in an array.([geeksforgeeks.org][2], [geeksforgeeks.org][3])

**Medium:**

* Find the longest subarray with a given sum.
* Count subarrays having a sum equal to `k`.
* Find the maximum sum subarray of size `k`.([geeksforgeeks.org][4], [geeksforgeeks.org][3], [techiedelight.com][5])

**Hard:**

* Find the largest submatrix with sum 0.
* Find the subarray sum divisible by `k`.
* Count distinct elements in every window of size `k`.([geeksforgeeks.org][3], [geeksforgeeks.org][4])

### **Sliding Window**

The Sliding Window technique is used to solve problems involving arrays or lists where a subarray or subsequence is required to be analyzed. This technique allows you to reduce the time complexity of problems that would typically involve nested loops.([geeksforgeeks.org][6])

**Easy:**

* Maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`.
* Smallest window containing all characters of a string.
* Count strictly increasing subarrays.([geeksforgeeks.org][6], [geeksforgeeks.org][4])

**Medium:**

* Longest substring with distinct characters.
* Maximum number of fruits in two baskets.
* Subarrays product less than `k`.([geeksforgeeks.org][6])

**Hard:**

* Longest subarray with sum divisible by `k`.
* Count occurrences of anagrams.
* Largest sum subarray of size at least `k`.([geeksforgeeks.org][4], [geeksforgeeks.org][6])

### **Hashing**

Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys and values into the hash table by using a hash function. It is done for faster access to elements.([geeksforgeeks.org][4])

**Easy:**

* Find whether an array is a subset of another array.
* Find the frequency of each character in a string.
* Find the first non-repeating character in a string.([geeksforgeeks.org][4])

**Medium:**

* Find the length of the longest consecutive sequence in an array.
* Group all anagrams in an array of strings.
* Find the majority element in an array.([geeksforgeeks.org][4])

**Hard:**

* Implement LRU Cache.
* Find the longest substring with `k` unique characters.
* Find the minimum window in a string containing all characters of another string.([geeksforgeeks.org][4])

## ✅ Recommended Practice Plan

To effectively prepare, focus on solving at least 25 problems across these categories:

* **Prefix Sum:** 5 problems
* **Sliding Window:** 10 problems
* **Hashing:** 10 problems([en.wikipedia.org][7], [geeksforgeeks.org][4])

This balanced approach will help you build a strong foundation in these essential techniques.

Great! If you're asked to solve the **"Longest Consecutive Sequence"** problem in an interview, here’s exactly how you can **discuss and solve it step by step**, just like a strong candidate.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement (as usually given in interviews):

> Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
> You must solve it in O(n) time.

📌 Example:

```python
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Interview Discussion Strategy

### **Step 1: Clarify the problem**

> “Just to confirm, we’re looking for the length of the longest sequence of consecutive numbers in an unsorted array, right? And duplicates can exist or not?”

Ask:

* Can the array have duplicates?
* Can it have negative numbers?
* Is the array empty sometimes?

### **Step 2: Brute force idea (but mention it's not optimal)**

> “One naive approach is to sort the array and then look for consecutive elements, but sorting takes O(n log n), which doesn't meet the O(n) requirement.”

**You mention this to show you're thinking — but you’re not choosing it.**

---

### **Step 3: Introduce the optimal solution idea (HashSet method)**

> “To achieve O(n), we can use a HashSet. The idea is:

* Add all elements to a set.
* For each number, check if it’s the *start* of a sequence (i.e., num - 1 is not in the set).
* If it is, then count how long the sequence goes: num + 1, num + 2, ...
* Track the maximum length found.”

---

### **Step 4: Write clean code**

```python
def longest_consecutive(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    num_set = set(nums)
    longest = 0

    for num in num_set:
        # Only start counting from the beginning of a sequence
        if num - 1 not in num_set:
            current_num = num
            current_streak = 1

            while current_num + 1 in num_set:
                current_num += 1
                current_streak += 1

            longest = max(longest, current_streak)

    return longest
```

---

### **Step 5: Dry-run with example**

> “Let’s walk through \[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]:

* Set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 100, 200}
* Start from 1 → \[1, 2, 3, 4] → length = 4
* 100 and 200 are not part of any longer sequence
* So the result is 4.”

---

### **Step 6: Time and Space Complexity**

> * Time: O(n) because we visit each number at most twice (once in set creation, once in loop).
> * Space: O(n) for the set.

---

## ✅ How You Wrap It Up:

> "This solution meets the O(n) time requirement using a HashSet, handles empty arrays, and avoids sorting. It's efficient and clean."
