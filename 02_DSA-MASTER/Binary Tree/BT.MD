# 🌳 BINARY TREES — Important Notes for Interviews

---

## 🔹 1. **What is a Binary Tree?**

A **Binary Tree** is a tree data structure where each node has **at most two children**, usually named:

* `left`
* `right`

---

## 🔹 2. **Types of Binary Trees**

| Type                         | Description                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Full Binary Tree**         | Every node has 0 or 2 children                                   |
| **Perfect Binary Tree**      | All internal nodes have 2 children, all leaves at same level     |
| **Complete Binary Tree**     | All levels filled except possibly the last, filled left to right |
| **Balanced Binary Tree**     | Height = O(log n) (e.g., AVL, Red-Black Trees)                   |
| **Degenerate Tree**          | Each node has only one child (like a linked list)                |
| **Binary Search Tree (BST)** | Left < Root < Right (ordered binary tree)                        |

---

## 🔹 3. **Node Structure in Python**

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

---

## 🔹 4. **Tree Traversals (Important)**

| Traversal       | Order                | Usage                       |
| --------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Inorder**     | Left → Root → Right  | BST ⇒ Sorted order          |
| **Preorder**    | Root → Left → Right  | Used to clone trees         |
| **Postorder**   | Left → Right → Root  | Delete nodes, compute depth |
| **Level Order** | Level-by-level (BFS) | Use `queue` (BFS)           |

### 🌟 Inorder of BST is always **sorted**!

---

## 🔹 5. **Common Tree Algorithms**

| Algorithm/Operation          | Notes                               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Height / Depth of tree       | Recursive / DFS                     |
| Count nodes / leaves         | Simple DFS                          |
| Max Depth / Min Depth        | DFS / BFS                           |
| Balanced Tree check          | Check depth difference ≤ 1          |
| Invert / Mirror a tree       | Swap left ↔ right recursively       |
| Path Sum                     | Backtracking / DFS                  |
| Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) | Recursion / Parent Pointers         |
| Diameter of Binary Tree      | Max path length between any 2 nodes |
| Serialize/Deserialize        | BFS or Preorder-based               |
| Vertical / Zigzag traversal  | Use BFS with level/column tracking  |
| Morris Traversal             | O(1) space inorder traversal        |

---

## 🔹 6. **Binary Search Tree (BST) Specific Problems**

| Problem                         | Key Idea                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Validate BST                    | Recursion with min/max bounds   |
| Search / Insert / Delete in BST | Recursion based on BST property |
| Inorder Successor / Predecessor | Use BST traversal               |
| Kth smallest/largest            | Inorder traversal + counter     |
| Convert sorted array to BST     | Divide and conquer              |
| Lowest Common Ancestor in BST   | Use BST properties              |

---

## 🔹 7. **Traversals: Recursive vs Iterative**

* **Recursive** is clean and preferred unless you need to avoid call stack usage.
* **Iterative**:

  * Use **stack** for DFS
  * Use **queue** for BFS

---

## 🔹 8. **Time and Space Complexities**

| Operation                  | Time (Avg) | Time (Worst)      | Space          |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Insert/Delete/Search (BST) | O(log n)   | O(n) (unbalanced) | O(n) recursive |
| Traversals                 | O(n)       | O(n)              | O(n)           |
| Balanced Tree operations   | O(log n)   | —                 | —              |

> ❗ Worst-case time is O(n) for unbalanced trees (like linked list).

---

## 🔹 9. **Binary Tree vs Binary Search Tree (BST)**

| Feature       | Binary Tree            | Binary Search Tree          |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Node ordering | No specific order      | Left < Root < Right         |
| Search time   | O(n)                   | O(log n) average            |
| Applications  | Hierarchical structure | Efficient lookup and insert |

---

## 🔹 10. **Helper Techniques to Master**

* Use **queue** for level order (BFS)
* Use **stack** for iterative DFS
* Track **level, column, parent** when needed
* Use **recursion with return values** for problems like:

  * LCA
  * Diameter
  * Subtree match
