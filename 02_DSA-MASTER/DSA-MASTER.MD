To crack **any SDE interview (SDE-I to SDE-III)** — especially at **product-based companies** like **Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Atlassian, etc.** — you need to **master key DSA concepts** and solve **around 150–200 quality problems** covering all patterns.

Below is a **complete DSA preparation roadmap** with **topic-wise concepts + number of must-do questions + example problems**.
