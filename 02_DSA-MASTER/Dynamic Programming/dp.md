**Dynamic Programming (DP)** is a powerful algorithmic technique used to **optimize recursive problems** by **storing intermediate results**. It is especially useful for problems with **overlapping subproblems** and **optimal substructure**.

## üîë Core Concepts

| Term                        | Meaning                                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overlapping Subproblems** | Same problems solved multiple times (e.g., Fibonacci) |
| **Optimal Substructure**    | Problem can be solved using solutions of subproblems  |
| **Memoization**             | Top-down DP: Store results of recursive calls         |
| **Tabulation**              | Bottom-up DP: Build solution iteratively              |

## üîÅ 1. **Memoization (Top-Down)**

You write a **recursive solution** and cache results.

### Example: Fibonacci

```python
def fib(n, memo={}):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    if n not in memo:
        memo[n] = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

## üìã 2. **Tabulation (Bottom-Up)**

You **build a table** from smaller subproblems to the final answer.

### Example: Fibonacci

```python
def fib(n):
    dp = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        dp.append(dp[i-1] + dp[i-2])
    return dp[n]
```

## üß± 3. Typical DP Problem Types

| Problem Type              | Examples                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1D DP                     | Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs                 |
| 2D DP                     | Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence       |
| DP with States            | Edit Distance, Matrix Chain Multiplication |
| Subset/Partition Problems | Subset Sum, Equal Partition                |
| Greedy + DP               | Jump Game II, Minimum Path Sum             |

## üéØ Steps to Solve DP Problems

1. **Identify subproblem** ‚Äì What is the smallest version?
2. **Define DP state** ‚Äì What parameters define your state?
3. **Recurrence relation** ‚Äì How does state `i` depend on previous?
4. **Base case(s)** ‚Äì What are the simplest cases?
5. **Decide memoization or tabulation**
6. **Optimize space (if needed)**
