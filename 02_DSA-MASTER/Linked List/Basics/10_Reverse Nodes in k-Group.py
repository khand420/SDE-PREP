# ‚úÖ Problem Summary
# Given a singly linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time and return the modified list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k, leave the last remaining nodes as-is.

# üß† Step-by-Step Approach (Recursive Solution)

# üîπ Step 1: Check if there are at least k nodes to reverse
# * Start with a temporary pointer (temp = head) and a counter.
# * Traverse k nodes ahead.
# * If there are fewer than k nodes, return head as-is (don‚Äôt reverse).

# üîπ Step 2: Recursively process the rest of the list
# * After confirming the current group has at least k nodes, move temp k steps forward.
# * Recursively call reverseKGroup(temp, k) to process and reverse the rest of the list.
# * The returned node will be the head of the already processed (reversed) part.

# üîπ Step 3: Reverse the current group of k nodes
# * Use a standard in-place linked list reversal technique for k nodes.
# * For each node in the group:
#     * Save next_node = curr.next
#     * Reverse the pointer: curr.next = prevNode
#     * Move prevNode and curr forward
# * The prevNode becomes the new head of the current group.

# üîπ Step 4: Return the new head
# * Return prevNode (the new head of the current reversed group).
# * It will get linked properly by the previous recursive call.

# üîÑ Visual Example:
# Given: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and k = 2
# 1. First group: reverse 1 -> 2 ‚Üí becomes 2 -> 1
# 2. Recurse on 3 -> 4 -> 5
# 3. Second group: reverse 3 -> 4 ‚Üí becomes 4 -> 3
# 4. Last node 5 remains as-is (less than k)
# 5. Final result: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5

# ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity
# * Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the list. Every node is visited once.
# * Space Complexity: O(N/k) recursive stack calls (worst-case O(N) in deeply nested calls). Can be reduced to O(1) with an iterative solution.
