# Problem Summary
# Given the head of a singly linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must perform the swap by changing the node connections (not just values).

# üß† Step-by-Step Approach (Recursive & Iterative Available)
# Let's cover the recursive approach first, then briefly mention the iterative one.

# üîÅ Recursive Approach

# üîπ Step 1: Base Case Check
# * If the list is empty (head is None) or only one node remains (head.next is None), there‚Äôs nothing to swap.
# * Return head as-is.

# üîπ Step 2: Identify the First Two Nodes
# * first = head
# * second = head.next
# These are the two nodes to be swapped.

# üîπ Step 3: Recursively Swap the Rest of the List
# * Call self.swapPairs(second.next) ‚Äî this swaps the remaining list starting from the third node.
# * Attach the returned node to first.next ‚Äî connecting the swapped rest to the first node.

# üîπ Step 4: Perform the Swap
# * second.next = first
# * first.next = recursively swapped head
# * Return second as the new head of this pair.

# üß© Visual Example:
# For input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
# Recursive steps:
# 1. Swap 1 and 2 ‚Üí 2 -> 1
# 2. Recursively call on 3 -> 4
# 3. Swap 3 and 4 ‚Üí 4 -> 3
# 4. Connect: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3

# ‚úÖ Final Recursive Structure
# python
# CopyEdit
# class Solution:
#     def swapPairs(self, head):
#         if not head or not head.next:
#             return head
        
#         first = head
#         second = head.next
        
#         # Swap the rest recursively
#         first.next = self.swapPairs(second.next)
#         second.next = first
        
#         return second

# üîÑ Iterative (Optional)
# Use a dummy node and a loop to swap in place:
# 1. Initialize dummy = ListNode(0) and point dummy.next = head.
# 2. Use a pointer prev to track the node before the pair.
# 3. Loop through the list in pairs and swap nodes using prev, first, and second.

# ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity
# * Time Complexity: O(N) ‚Äî each node is visited once.
# * Space Complexity:
#     * Recursive: O(N) due to the recursion stack
#     * Iterative: O(1) (no extra space used)
