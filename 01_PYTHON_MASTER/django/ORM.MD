Here are some interview questions related to Django ORM queries that are suitable for a developer with 3 years of experience:

### Basic Questions:

1. **What is Django ORM and how does it differ from SQL?**
   - Explain the concept of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
   - Discuss the advantages and limitations of using ORM vs raw SQL.

2. **How would you retrieve all objects from a model?**
   - Write a query to retrieve all objects from a model called `Product`.

3. **How do you filter querysets in Django ORM?**
   - How would you retrieve all products where the `price` is greater than 100?
   - What is the difference between `.filter()` and `.exclude()` methods?

4. **How would you get a single object from a model?**
   - What is the difference between `.get()` and `.filter()` in Django ORM?

5. **What is the use of `select_related` and `prefetch_related` in Django ORM?**
   - Explain with examples when to use `select_related` vs `prefetch_related`.
   - What are the performance benefits of using these methods?

### Intermediate Questions:

6. **How would you perform an update on a queryset?**
   - How would you increment the `inventory_count` of all products by 10?

7. **What are `F` expressions in Django and how are they useful?**
   - Provide an example where you need to update a field based on its current value.

8. **Explain how to perform aggregate functions in Django ORM.**
   - How would you calculate the total sum of all product prices?
   - How would you calculate the average price of products in a specific category?

9. **How would you handle many-to-many relationships in Django ORM?**
   - How do you retrieve all the related objects in a many-to-many relationship?
   - Explain how to add and remove relationships in a many-to-many field.

10. **How do you perform complex lookups using `Q` objects in Django ORM?**
    - How would you write a query to find all products that are either in the "Electronics" category or have a price greater than 500?

### Advanced Questions:

11. **What is the purpose of `annotate()` in Django ORM?**
    - How would you annotate each `Order` with the total number of products it contains?

12. **How would you use the `Subquery` and `OuterRef` in Django ORM?**
    - Write a query that annotates each `Product` with the latest `Order` date.

13. **How would you optimize a query that involves multiple related models?**
    - Discuss strategies for minimizing database hits when working with related models.

14. **How do you perform a raw SQL query in Django, and when should it be used?**
    - Provide an example of when you might need to use raw SQL instead of Django ORM.

15. **Explain how to use `transaction.atomic()` in Django.**
    - What is the purpose of using `transaction.atomic()`? Provide a use case.

### Problem-Solving Questions:

16. **Given a `Product` model and an `Order` model, write a query to get the total revenue generated by each product.**
    - The `Order` model has a foreign key to `Product` and a `quantity` field.

17. **Write a Django ORM query to get the top 3 customers who have placed the most orders.**
    - How would you approach this using Django's aggregation tools?

18. **How would you find all products that have not been ordered in the last 6 months?**
    - Provide a query that uses Django ORM to accomplish this.

19. **Write a Django ORM query to retrieve all orders along with the total price of the products in each order.**
    - How would you optimize this query?

20. **How do you handle database migrations in Django when there are significant changes to the model?**
    - What are the steps to manage migrations in a large project?
    - How do you handle conflicts or issues arising from migrations?

### Behavioral Questions Related to Django ORM:

21. **Describe a situation where you had to optimize a slow query. What steps did you take, and what was the result?**
    - How did you identify the performance bottleneck?
    - What changes did you make to improve the query performance?

22. **Have you ever had to perform a data migration in Django? Describe the process and challenges you faced.**
    - How did you ensure data integrity during the migration?

23. **Discuss a time when you had to refactor a complex Django ORM query. What were the challenges, and how did you ensure the query remained correct and efficient?**

### Scenario-Based Questions:

24. **Imagine you have a Django application where users can post articles, and each article can have multiple comments. How would you write a query to retrieve the top 5 articles based on the number of comments?**

25. **You have a model with a large number of records, and you need to display them on a webpage with pagination. How would you implement efficient pagination in Django?**

These questions cover a wide range of topics related to Django ORM and should help evaluate a candidate's understanding and proficiency with Django ORM for a 3-year experienced developer.
