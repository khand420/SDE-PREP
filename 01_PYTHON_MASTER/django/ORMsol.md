Sure! Let's go through each of these questions in detail:

---

### 1. **What is Django ORM and how does it differ from SQL?**
**Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)** is a tool in Django that allows developers to interact with the database using Python code instead of raw SQL queries. It abstracts the database layer, allowing you to work with database records as if they were regular Python objects.

- **Django ORM**:
  - You work with Python objects and methods.
  - It's database-agnostic (you can switch databases with minimal changes).
  - It automatically escapes input to prevent SQL injection.

- **SQL**:
  - You write raw SQL queries.
  - It's tied to a specific database.
  - You have to manually handle input validation and escaping.

**Example**:
- **Django ORM**:
  ```python
  Product.objects.filter(category='Electronics')
  ```
- **SQL**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Product WHERE category='Electronics';
  ```

### 2. **How would you retrieve all objects from a model?**

**Using Django ORM**:
```python
products = Product.objects.all()
```
This will retrieve all objects from the `Product` model.

---

### 3. **How do you filter querysets in Django ORM?**

**Filtering Querysets**:
- To retrieve all products with a price greater than 100:
  ```python
  expensive_products = Product.objects.filter(price__gt=100)
  ```

- **Difference Between `.filter()` and `.exclude()`**:
  - `.filter()`: Includes records that match the condition.
  - `.exclude()`: Excludes records that match the condition.

---

### 4. **How would you get a single object from a model?**

**Using `.get()`**:
```python
product = Product.objects.get(id=1)
```
- `.get()` retrieves a single object that matches the given query. If no match is found, it raises a `DoesNotExist` exception. If multiple matches are found, it raises a `MultipleObjectsReturned` exception.

**Using `.filter()`**:
```python
product = Product.objects.filter(id=1).first()
```
- `.filter()` returns a queryset, so using `.first()` will get the first object or return `None` if no match is found.

---

### 5. **What is the use of `select_related` and `prefetch_related` in Django ORM?**

**`select_related`**:
- Used for **one-to-one** and **foreign key** relationships.
- It performs a SQL join and includes the related objects in the query, reducing the number of database queries.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  orders = Order.objects.select_related('product').all()
  ```

**`prefetch_related`**:
- Used for **many-to-many** and **many-to-one** relationships.
- It performs a separate lookup for each relationship and does a join in Python.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  products = Product.objects.prefetch_related('orders').all()
  ```

**Performance Benefit**: These methods reduce the number of database queries, improving performance, especially when dealing with related objects.

---

### 6. **How would you perform an update on a queryset?**

**Using `.update()`**:
- Increment the `inventory_count` of all products by 10:
  ```python
  Product.objects.update(inventory_count=F('inventory_count') + 10)
  ```
  Here, `F` expressions allow you to reference existing values in the database.

---

### 7. **What are `F` expressions in Django and how are they useful?**

**`F` Expressions**:
- `F` expressions are used to reference the value of a field in a database query without having to fetch the value into memory first.
- They are useful for performing database-side operations, such as increments or decrements.

**Example**:
- To increase the price of all products by 10%:
  ```python
  Product.objects.update(price=F('price') * 1.10)
  ```

---

### 8. **Explain how to perform aggregate functions in Django ORM.**

**Aggregations**:
- **Sum of all product prices**:
  ```python
  from django.db.models import Sum
  total_revenue = Product.objects.aggregate(Sum('price'))
  ```

- **Average price of products in a specific category**:
  ```python
  from django.db.models import Avg
  avg_price = Product.objects.filter(category='Electronics').aggregate(Avg('price'))
  ```

---

### 9. **How would you handle many-to-many relationships in Django ORM?**

**Retrieving Related Objects**:
- If you have a `Product` model with a `Tag` model (many-to-many):
  ```python
  tags = product.tags.all()
  ```

**Adding/Removing Relationships**:
- **Add a tag to a product**:
  ```python
  product.tags.add(tag)
  ```

- **Remove a tag from a product**:
  ```python
  product.tags.remove(tag)
  ```

---

### 10. **How do you perform complex lookups using `Q` objects in Django ORM?**

**Using `Q` Objects**:
- **Finding products that are either in "Electronics" or have a price greater than 500**:
  ```python
  from django.db.models import Q
  products = Product.objects.filter(Q(category='Electronics') | Q(price__gt=500))
  ```

**`Q` Objects** allow you to create complex queries with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` conditions.

---

### 11. **What is the purpose of `annotate()` in Django ORM?**

**`annotate()`**:
- Itâ€™s used to add additional fields to each object in a queryset based on aggregates.
- **Example**: Annotating each `Order` with the total number of products:
  ```python
  from django.db.models import Count
  orders = Order.objects.annotate(total_products=Count('products'))
  ```

---

### 12. **How would you use the `Subquery` and `OuterRef` in Django ORM?**

**Subquery and OuterRef**:
- **Example**: Annotating each `Product` with the latest `Order` date:
  ```python
  from django.db.models import Subquery, OuterRef
  latest_order = Order.objects.filter(product_id=OuterRef('pk')).order_by('-date').values('date')[:1]
  products = Product.objects.annotate(latest_order_date=Subquery(latest_order))
  ```

---

### 13. **How would you optimize a query that involves multiple related models?**

**Optimizing Queries**:
- **Use `select_related` for foreign key relationships**: This reduces the number of queries by performing a join.
  ```python
  orders = Order.objects.select_related('customer').all()
  ```
  
- **Use `prefetch_related` for many-to-many relationships**: This avoids the N+1 query problem.
  ```python
  products = Product.objects.prefetch_related('tags').all()
  ```

- **Use `only()` or `defer()`**: Load only the fields you need.
  ```python
  products = Product.objects.only('name', 'price').all()
  ```

---

### 14. **How do you perform a raw SQL query in Django, and when should it be used?**

**Using Raw SQL**:
- **Example**:
  ```python
  products = Product.objects.raw('SELECT * FROM myapp_product WHERE price > %s', [100])
  ```

**When to use**:
- When the ORM cannot express the query you need.
- When performance is critical and the ORM adds too much overhead.

---

### 15. **Explain how to use `transaction.atomic()` in Django.**

**`transaction.atomic()`**:
- It ensures that a series of operations are executed as a single transaction. If any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from django.db import transaction

  def create_order(customer, products):
      with transaction.atomic():
          order = Order.objects.create(customer=customer)
          for product in products:
              OrderItem.objects.create(order=order, product=product)
  ```

**Use Case**:
- Ensuring data integrity when multiple related operations must either all succeed or all fail.

---

### 16. **Given a `Product` model and an `Order` model, write a query to get the total revenue generated by each product.**

**Total Revenue by Product**:
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from django.db.models import Sum, F

  revenue_by_product = Product.objects.annotate(
      total_revenue=Sum(F('order__quantity') * F('price'))
  )
  ```

---

### 17. **Write a Django ORM query to get the top 3 customers who have placed the most orders.**

**Top 3 Customers by Orders**:
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from django.db.models import Count

  top_customers = Order.objects.values('customer__name').annotate(
      total_orders=Count('id')
  ).order_by('-total_orders')[:3]
  ```

---

### 18. **How would you find all products that have not been ordered in the last 6 months?**

**Products Not Ordered Recently**:
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from django.utils import timezone
  from datetime import timedelta

  six_months_ago = timezone.now() - timedelta(days=6*30)
  products = Product.objects.exclude(
     

 id__in=Order.objects.filter(order_date__gte=six_months_ago).values('product_id')
  )
  ```

---

### 19. **Write a Django ORM query to retrieve all orders along with the total price of the products in each order.**

**Total Price per Order**:
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from django.db.models import Sum, F

  orders_with_total = Order.objects.annotate(
      total_price=Sum(F('product__price') * F('quantity'))
  )
  ```

**Optimization**: Use `select_related` to fetch related products and avoid extra queries.

---

### 20. **How do you handle database migrations in Django when there are significant changes to the model?**

**Handling Migrations**:
- **Create Migration**: Use `python manage.py makemigrations` to create the migration file.
- **Review Migration**: Manually review and modify the migration if necessary.
- **Apply Migration**: Use `python manage.py migrate` to apply the migration.

**Handling Conflicts**:
- **Rebase or Merge**: When there are conflicts, rebase or merge the conflicting migrations.
- **Data Migrations**: Use `RunPython` for custom data migrations.

**Handling Issues**:
- **Rollback**: If an issue occurs, use `python manage.py migrate <appname> <previous_migration>` to roll back.
- **Fix and Retry**: Make the necessary changes and re-run the migration.

---

### 21. **Describe a situation where you had to optimize a slow query. What steps did you take, and what was the result?**

**Example Situation**:
- **Scenario**: The app was slow due to an N+1 query problem when loading related models.
- **Steps Taken**:
  - Identified the N+1 problem using Django Debug Toolbar.
  - Applied `select_related` and `prefetch_related` to reduce the number of queries.
  - Added database indices to frequently filtered fields.
- **Result**: Query time reduced from 3 seconds to under 0.5 seconds.

---

### 22. **Have you ever had to perform a data migration in Django? Describe the process and challenges you faced.**

**Data Migration Example**:
- **Scenario**: Needed to backfill a new field with data from an existing field.
- **Process**:
  - Created a migration with `RunPython` to write a Python function to populate the new field.
  - Handled edge cases (e.g., null values).
- **Challenges**:
  - Large dataset causing timeouts.
  - Solution: Ran the migration in batches.
  - Ensured data consistency by testing in a staging environment before applying to production.

---

### 23. **Discuss a time when you had to refactor a complex Django ORM query. What were the challenges, and how did you ensure the query remained correct and efficient?**

**Example**:
- **Scenario**: The app had a complex query with multiple joins, leading to slow performance.
- **Challenges**:
  - Complex joins made the query difficult to optimize.
  - Some conditions required raw SQL to express.
- **Refactor**:
  - Split the query into smaller subqueries and used `Subquery` and `OuterRef`.
  - Replaced some parts of the query with raw SQL for performance.
  - Added unit tests to ensure the refactor didnâ€™t break functionality.
- **Result**: The refactored query was both faster and easier to maintain.

### 24. **Imagine you have a Django application where users can post articles, and each article can have multiple comments. How would you write a query to retrieve the top 5 articles based on the number of comments?**

**Top 5 Articles by Comment Count**:
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from django.db.models import Count

  top_articles = Article.objects.annotate(
      comment_count=Count('comments')
  ).order_by('-comment_count')[:5]
  ```

---

### 25. **You have a model with a large number of records, and you need to display them on a webpage with pagination. How would you implement efficient pagination in Django?**

**Efficient Pagination**:
- **Using Djangoâ€™s built-in Paginator**:
  ```python
  from django.core.paginator import Paginator

  products = Product.objects.all()
  paginator = Paginator(products, 10)  # 10 products per page

  page_number = request.GET.get('page')
  page_obj = paginator.get_page(page_number)
  ```

**Optimization**:
- **Use `only()` or `defer()`**: Load only the fields you need for display.
- **Index the fields used for ordering**: Ensure that the database can quickly retrieve the correct subset of records.
