### Advanced Django Interview Questions

#### 1. How does Django's ORM work? Explain the concept of QuerySets and how they are used.
Django's **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** allows you to interact with your database using Python code instead of writing raw SQL queries. The ORM maps database tables to Python classes, and table rows to instances of those classes.

- **QuerySets:** A QuerySet is a collection of database queries to retrieve objects from your database. They are lazy, meaning they do not hit the database until the QuerySet is evaluated. You can filter, order, and manipulate QuerySets before executing them.

Example:
```python
# models.py
class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=50)

# QuerySet usage
books = Book.objects.all()  # Retrieve all books
filtered_books = books.filter(author="John Doe")  # Filter books by author
```

#### 2. What is the role of middleware in Django? How would you create custom middleware?
**Middleware** is a way to process requests globally before they reach the view or after the view has processed them. Middleware components are executed in a defined order during the request/response cycle.

**Creating Custom Middleware:**
```python
# myapp/middleware.py
class CustomMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        # Code to execute before the view (and later middleware)
        response = self.get_response(request)
        # Code to execute after the view
        return response

# Adding middleware to settings.py
MIDDLEWARE = [
    'myapp.middleware.CustomMiddleware',
    # other middleware classes
]
```

#### 3. Explain the concept of signals in Django. Provide an example of how you might use them.
**Signals** allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers when some action has taken place. They are used to decouple applications by sending notifications when certain actions occur.

**Example Usage:**
```python
# myapp/models.py
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver

class UserProfile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    bio = models.TextField(blank=True)

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def create_user_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        UserProfile.objects.create(user=instance)

# Connecting signals
post_save.connect(create_user_profile, sender=User)
```

#### 4. What is the difference between `@api_view` and `APIView` in Django REST framework?
- **`@api_view`:** A decorator for function-based views. It converts the function into a RESTful view by handling request parsing, response rendering, and HTTP method dispatching.
  ```python
  from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
  from rest_framework.response import Response

  @api_view(['GET'])
  def my_view(request):
      return Response({"message": "Hello, World!"})
  ```

- **`APIView`:** A class-based view that provides more structure and reusable functionality. It allows the use of mixins and inheritance to build complex views.
  ```python
  from rest_framework.views import APIView
  from rest_framework.response import Response

  class MyView(APIView):
      def get(self, request):
          return Response({"message": "Hello, World!"})
  ```

#### 5. How would you implement caching in a Django application?
**Caching** improves performance by storing the result of expensive computations so that they can be retrieved quickly on subsequent requests.

**Example Implementation:**
1. **Configure Cache Backend in `settings.py`:**
   ```python
   CACHES = {
       'default': {
           'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache',
           'LOCATION': '127.0.0.1:11211',
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Using Low-Level Cache API:**
   ```python
   from django.core.cache import cache

   # Set a cache value
   cache.set('my_key', 'my_value', timeout=60*15)  # 15 minutes

   # Get a cache value
   value = cache.get('my_key')
   ```

3. **Using Cache in Views:**
   ```python
   from django.views.decorators.cache import cache_page

   @cache_page(60 * 15)  # Cache the view for 15 minutes
   def my_view(request):
       # view logic
       pass
   ```

#### 6. Explain the concept of Django's context processors. How would you create a custom context processor?
**Context processors** are functions that return a dictionary of context data which will be available to all templates.

**Creating a Custom Context Processor:**
1. **Define the context processor function:**
   ```python
   # myapp/context_processors.py
   def custom_context_processor(request):
       return {
           'my_variable': 'value'
       }
   ```

2. **Add the context processor to `settings.py`:**
   ```python
   TEMPLATES = [
       {
           'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
           'DIRS': [],
           'APP_DIRS': True,
           'OPTIONS': {
               'context_processors': [
                   'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                   'django.template.context_processors.request',
                   # other context processors
                   'myapp.context_processors.custom_context_processor',
               ],
           },
       },
   ]
   ```

#### 7. What are class-based views (CBVs) in Django, and how do they differ from function-based views (FBVs)?
- **Class-Based Views (CBVs):** Provide a way to organize view logic in classes instead of functions. They offer more structure and reusable functionality through inheritance and mixins.
  ```python
  from django.views import View
  from django.http import HttpResponse

  class MyView(View):
      def get(self, request):
          return HttpResponse('Hello, World!')
  ```

- **Function-Based Views (FBVs):** Simple functions that handle requests. They are more straightforward and may be easier to understand for simpler logic.
  ```python
  from django.http import HttpResponse

  def my_view(request):
      return HttpResponse('Hello, World!')
  ```

#### 8. How would you handle file uploads in a Django application?
1. **Create a Model to Handle File Uploads:**
   ```python
   # myapp/models.py
   class Document(models.Model):
       title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       file = models.FileField(upload_to='documents/')
   ```

2. **Create a Form for File Upload:**
   ```python
   # myapp/forms.py
   from django import forms

   class DocumentForm(forms.ModelForm):
       class Meta:
           model = Document
           fields = ['title', 'file']
   ```

3. **Handle the Upload in a View:**
   ```python
   # myapp/views.py
   from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
   from .forms import DocumentForm

   def upload_file(request):
       if request.method == 'POST':
           form = DocumentForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
           if form.is_valid():
               form.save()
               return redirect('success')
       else:
           form = DocumentForm()
       return render(request, 'upload.html', {'form': form})
   ```

#### 9. Explain the concept of Django's authentication and authorization system. How can you customize it?
**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user. **Authorization** is the process of checking what permissions an authenticated user has.

**Customization:**
1. **Custom User Model:**
   ```python
   # myapp/models.py
   from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

   class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
       additional_field = models.CharField(max_length=100)
   ```

   **Set the custom user model in `settings.py`:**
   ```python
   AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'myapp.CustomUser'
   ```

2. **Custom Permissions:**
   ```python
   from django.contrib.auth.models import Permission
   from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType

   content_type = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(MyModel)
   permission = Permission.objects.create(
       codename='can_do_something',
       name='Can Do Something',
       content_type=content_type,
   )
   ```

3. **Custom Authentication Backends:**
   ```python
   # myapp/authentication.py
   from django.contrib.auth.backends import BaseBackend

   class MyBackend(BaseBackend):
       def authenticate(self, request, username=None, password=None):
           # custom authentication logic
           pass

       def get_user(self, user_id):
           # custom get user logic
           pass
   ```

   **Set the custom backend in `settings.py`:**
   ```python
   AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = ['myapp.authentication.MyBackend']
   ```

#### 10. How would you handle performance optimization in a Django application?
- **Database Optimization:**
  - Use **select_related** and **prefetch_related** to optimize queries.
  - Add proper **indexes** to your database tables.
  - Avoid N+1 query problems.

- **Caching:**
  - Use **Django's caching framework** to cache expensive computations and queries.
  - Cache views using the `cache_page` decorator.

- **Efficient Query Usage:**
  - Optimize QuerySets to retrieve only necessary data.
  - Use `values` and `values_list` for retrieving specific fields.

- **Static and Media Files:**
  - Serve static

 and media files through a dedicated server (e.g., Nginx).
  - Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

- **Middleware:**
  - Review and optimize middleware usage.
  - Avoid unnecessary middleware in the stack.

- **Asynchronous Processing:**
  - Use **Celery** for background tasks and offload heavy computations.

- **Profiling and Monitoring:**
  - Use tools like **Django Debug Toolbar** and **New Relic** to profile and monitor your application.
  - Identify and optimize bottlenecks.
