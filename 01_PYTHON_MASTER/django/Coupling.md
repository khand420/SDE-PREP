### Coupling

**Coupling** refers to the degree of interdependence between software components. It describes how closely connected different parts of a system are and how much they rely on each other.

1. **Tight Coupling**:
   - Components are highly dependent on each other.
   - Changes in one component often require changes in another.
   - Examples: Direct method calls, shared global variables.

2. **Loose Coupling**:
   - Components are independent or have minimal dependencies.
   - Changes in one component do not significantly affect others.
   - Examples: Interfaces, events, and middleware.

### Decoupling

**Decoupling** is the process of reducing the dependencies between components. This is achieved by designing systems in a way that allows components to operate independently.

1. **Benefits of Decoupling**:
   - **Maintainability**: Easier to update or modify components without affecting the entire system.
   - **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts or projects.
   - **Scalability**: Systems can grow more easily as components can be added or modified independently.
   - **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation, improving the quality of the code.

### Summary

- **Coupling** measures the interdependence between components.
- **Decoupling** is the practice of designing components to minimize dependencies, leading to more flexible and maintainable systems.
