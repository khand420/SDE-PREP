Django follows a **loose coupling** architecture. Here are some key points to explain this:

### Loose Coupling in Django

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Django separates different components (models, views, templates) which allows for easier maintenance and scalability.

2. **Modular Design**:
   - Applications in Django can be developed as separate modules (apps) that can function independently and can be reused across different projects.

3. **Flexible Configuration**:
   - Django allows for easy swapping of components (like changing the database backend or using different authentication methods) without affecting the overall application.

4. **Middleware**:
   - Django's middleware system allows developers to insert custom processing at various points in the request/response cycle, promoting loose coupling.

5. **Signals**:
   - Django supports signals, which enable decoupled applications to get notified when certain actions occur elsewhere in the application.

### Tight Coupling
- In contrast, tight coupling occurs when components are highly dependent on each other, making changes difficult and increasing the risk of breaking other parts of the system.

### Conclusion
Overall, Django's design encourages loose coupling, making it easier to manage, extend, and integrate with other systems or components.
