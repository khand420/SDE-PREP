In Django, **F** and **Q** objects are powerful tools used for performing complex queries and manipulations on your database.

### F Object

- **Definition**: The `F` object allows you to refer to model field values directly in queries. This is particularly useful for operations that involve comparisons or arithmetic with the values of fields within the same model instance.

- **Usage**: You can use `F` objects to avoid loading data into memory, enabling more efficient database operations.

- **Example**:
  ```python
  from django.db.models import F
  from myapp.models import Product

  # Increase the price of all products by 10%
  Product.objects.update(price=F('price') * 1.1)
  ```

### Q Object

- **Definition**: The `Q` object is used to encapsulate a collection of keyword arguments. It allows you to construct complex queries with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operations.

- **Usage**: You can combine multiple `Q` objects to create complex query conditions.

- **Example**:
  ```python
  from django.db.models import Q
  from myapp.models import Product

  # Get products that are either in stock or have a price less than $20
  products = Product.objects.filter(Q(in_stock=True) | Q(price__lt=20))
  ```

### Summary

- **F Object**: Use for direct field value manipulation and comparisons within the same instance.
- **Q Object**: Use for building complex queries with logical operators.

These objects enhance your ability to perform efficient and complex queries in Django. Let me know if you have any questions or need further examples!
