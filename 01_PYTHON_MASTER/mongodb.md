Sure! Here are the answers to the frequently asked MongoDB interview questions:

1. **What is MongoDB?**
   - MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing for dynamic schemas. It is designed for scalability, high availability, and performance.

2. **What are the advantages of using MongoDB over traditional RDBMS?**
   - Advantages include:
     - **Schema Flexibility:** Documents can have varying structures.
     - **Scalability:** Easy to scale horizontally by adding more servers.
     - **Performance:** Optimized for read and write operations with features like indexing.
     - **High Availability:** Supports replica sets for fault tolerance.

3. **What is a document in MongoDB?**
   - A document is a basic unit of data in MongoDB, stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format. It is a set of key-value pairs, similar to JSON objects.

4. **What is a collection in MongoDB?**
   - A collection is a group of MongoDB documents, analogous to a table in relational databases. Collections do not enforce a schema, allowing for diverse document structures.

5. **How does MongoDB handle data modeling?**
   - Data modeling can be done using:
     - **Embedded Documents:** Nesting documents within other documents for related data.
     - **References:** Linking documents using ObjectIDs for relationships.

6. **What is the difference between `find()` and `findOne()`?**
   - `find()` returns a cursor that can iterate over multiple documents matching the query, while `findOne()` returns a single document that matches the query criteria.

7. **What are indexes in MongoDB?**
   - Indexes are special data structures that improve query performance by allowing faster data retrieval. They can be created on one or multiple fields in a document.

8. **What is the aggregation framework in MongoDB?**
   - The aggregation framework is a powerful tool for processing and transforming data. It allows for operations like filtering, grouping, and sorting through a pipeline of stages.

9. **What is sharding in MongoDB?**
   - Sharding is a method of horizontally scaling a database by distributing data across multiple servers (shards). Each shard holds a subset of the data, improving performance and capacity.

10. **What are replica sets in MongoDB?**
    - A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy and high availability. One member is the primary (accepts writes), while others are secondaries (replicate data).

11. **How do you perform transactions in MongoDB?**
    - MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, allowing multiple operations to be executed as a single atomic operation. Transactions ensure data consistency even across multiple documents.

12. **What is the purpose of the `$set` operator?**
    - The `$set` operator is used to update the value of a field in a document. If the field does not exist, it will be created.

13. **How do you handle data validation in MongoDB?**
    - Data validation can be enforced using JSON Schema validation rules at the collection level, specifying required fields, data types, and constraints.

14. **What are the different types of queries you can perform in MongoDB?**
    - Common query operators include:
      - `$eq`, `$gt`, `$lt`, `$in`, `$exists`, `$and`, `$or`, among others, for filtering documents based on various conditions.

15. **How do you backup and restore a MongoDB database?**
    - Backup can be performed using tools like `mongodump` for logical backups or `mongorestore` for restoring. For physical backups, one can use filesystem snapshots or cloud-based solutions.
