   - **What is your approach to building data models for form intelligence?**
     - **Answer:** "I start by understanding the data and its structure. Then, I define models that can accurately represent the data, using Django ORM for ease of manipulation and querying. I ensure the models are scalable and optimized for performance."

6. **Form Processing:**
   - **Explain how you would build a system to extract and process data from forms.**
     - **Answer:** "I would use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to extract text from scanned forms. Then, I would process this data using NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques to identify and categorize information. Finally, I would store the processed data in a database for further analysis."
   - **How would you handle the post-processing of data extracted from forms?**
     - **Answer:** "I would validate and clean the extracted data, normalize it, and transform it into a structured format. This might involve removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data types as needed."

#### REST Endpoints and GitHub:
7. **RESTful API:**
   - **How do you design and implement RESTful endpoints in Django or Flask?**
     - **Answer:** "In Django, I use Django REST Framework to define serializers for data representation and create viewsets for CRUD operations. I then use routers to automatically generate URLs for these endpoints. In Flask, I use Flask-RESTful to define resources and endpoints."
   - **Describe how you would secure REST API endpoints.**
     - **Answer:** "I secure REST API endpoints using token-based authentication (like JWT), HTTPS to encrypt data transmission, and implementing proper authorization checks. I also validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent attacks like SQL injection."

8. **Version Control:**
   - **How do you use GitHub in your development process?**
     - **Answer:** "I use GitHub for version control, branching, and collaboration. I follow best practices like committing frequently with meaningful messages, creating feature branches, and using pull requests for code reviews and merging."
   - **Can you describe a situation where you used Git branching strategies?**
     - **Answer:** "In a recent project, we used GitFlow branching strategy. We had separate branches for features, hotfixes, and releases. This helped us manage development and deployment efficiently, ensuring that our main branch was always stable."

#### C# Knowledge:
9. **Interoperability:**
   - **How would you integrate Python applications with a C# system?**
     - **Answer:** "I would use APIs to enable communication between Python and C# applications. For instance, I might expose functionalities of the C# system as RESTful endpoints that the Python application can consume. Alternatively, I could use a message broker like RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication."
   - **Can you give an example of when you needed to use C# in a Python project?**
     - **Answer:** "In one project, we had a legacy C# system that needed to integrate with a new Python-based analytics engine. We exposed the necessary functionalities of the C# system as REST APIs, which the Python application consumed to fetch data and perform analysis."
