### Class Method
- **Definition**: A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. It takes `cls` as its first parameter, which refers to the class itself.
- **Usage**: Class methods are often used for factory methods, which instantiate instances of the class using different parameters than those provided to the class constructor.
- **Decorator**: Defined with the `@classmethod` decorator.

**Example**:
```python
class MyClass:
    class_variable = 0

    @classmethod
    def increment_class_variable(cls):
        cls.class_variable += 1
        return cls.class_variable

# Usage
MyClass.increment_class_variable()  # Increments and returns 1
```

### Static Method
- **Definition**: A static method is a method that does not take `self` or `cls` as its first parameter. It behaves like a regular function that belongs to the class's namespace.
- **Usage**: Static methods are used when you want to perform a function that is related to the class but does not need access to class or instance-specific data.
- **Decorator**: Defined with the `@staticmethod` decorator.

**Example**:
```python
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def utility_function(x, y):
        return x + y

# Usage
result = MyClass.utility_function(5, 10)  # Returns 15
```

### Summary
- **Class Method**: Uses `cls`, operates on class-level data, and is defined with `@classmethod`.
- **Static Method**: Does not use `self` or `cls`, does not operate on class or instance data, and is defined with `@staticmethod`.

Both types of methods allow you to organize your code better and provide clarity on the intended usage within the class.
