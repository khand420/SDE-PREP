Designing a **File Storage System** like **Dropbox** (High-Level Design - HLD) involves building a system that supports:

* Uploading, downloading, sharing, and syncing files
* Handling large files efficiently
* Data replication and consistency
* Fault tolerance and scalability
* User authentication and permissions

## üìê High-Level Design (HLD): Dropbox-like File Storage System

### 1. **Core Features**

| Feature              | Description                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| File Upload/Download | Users can upload/download files of any size          |
| Sync                 | Files synced across devices in near real-time        |
| Versioning           | Maintain historical versions of files                |
| Sharing              | Share files/folders via links or user permissions    |
| Replication          | Data replicated for redundancy and high availability |
| Large File Support   | Chunked uploads and downloads                        |
| Auth & Authorization | Login, roles, access control                         |

## üß± System Components

### 1. **Client App**

* Desktop/mobile/web apps
* Handles chunked uploads/downloads
* Local caching and file change detection

### 2. **API Gateway**

* Authenticates requests
* Routes to appropriate services

### 3. **Metadata Service**

* Stores file metadata (name, size, owner, version)
* Tracks file chunks and storage locations

### 4. **Storage Service**

* Stores actual file data
* Supports chunking, replication, and retrieval
* Could use distributed file system (e.g., HDFS, Amazon S3, Ceph)

### 5. **Chunking/Upload Service**

* Splits large files into smaller chunks (e.g., 4 MB)
* Parallel uploads
* Retries failed chunks

### 6. **Database**

* Relational (e.g., PostgreSQL) for metadata
* NoSQL (e.g., Cassandra) for scalable metadata storage
* Redis for caching frequently accessed metadata

### 7. **Notification Service**

* Sends file update notifications (e.g., via WebSocket or push)

### 8. **Replication & Backup**

* Replicate files across regions or availability zones
* Use consensus (like Paxos/Raft) for consistency if needed

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Flow: Uploading a File

1. **Client splits file into chunks**
2. **Client sends chunk upload requests** ‚Üí Upload/Storage Service
3. Each chunk is stored with a **unique ID** (e.g., hash-based)
4. Metadata Service is updated with:

   * File path
   * Chunk references
   * Version
5. Replication Service ensures chunk copies across nodes
6. Once all chunks uploaded, file is marked as **complete**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Scaling Considerations

| Component      | Scaling Strategy                         |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Storage        | Horizontal scaling using blob storage    |
| Metadata DB    | Sharding and indexing                    |
| Upload Service | Stateless workers behind a load balancer |
| Notification   | Use message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)     |
| Caching        | Redis or Memcached for hot metadata      |

---

## üîÅ Replication & Consistency

* **Replication factor**: e.g., 3 copies
* **Eventually consistent** model for performance
* Use consistent hashing for file chunk distribution
* Quorum-based reads/writes if stronger consistency needed

---

## üîê Security

* TLS for data in transit
* Encryption at rest (AES-256)
* Per-user access control for files
* Token-based authentication (OAuth, JWT)

---

## üìä Metrics & Monitoring

* Upload/download success rate
* Latency per chunk upload
* Storage usage trends
* File sync lags
* Error rates

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

| Test Case               | Description                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Large File Upload       | Upload files >2GB with chunking              |
| Node Failure Recovery   | Simulate storage node crash and recover      |
| File Version Conflicts  | Same file edited on two devices              |
| Replication Consistency | Ensure all replicas are in sync              |
| Sync Latency            | Time to propagate file change to all devices |
| Upload Resume           | Resume from last successful chunk            |
| Permission Enforcement  | Unauthorized access attempts                 |

## üìÅ Example Tech Stack

| Component      | Technology                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Client Sync    | Native apps (Electron, Android, iOS) |
| API Gateway    | NGINX + Flask/FastAPI/Golang         |
| Metadata Store | PostgreSQL or Cassandra              |
| File Storage   | Amazon S3 / HDFS / Ceph / MinIO      |
| Upload Service | Python, Node.js                      |
| Caching        | Redis                                |

## üß† Trade-offs

| Trade-off                    | Explanation                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Consistency vs. Availability | Eventual consistency preferred for performance     |
| Chunk Size                   | Larger chunks = fewer requests, but harder retries |
| Metadata Scaling             | May become bottleneck ‚Üí need sharding/caching      |
