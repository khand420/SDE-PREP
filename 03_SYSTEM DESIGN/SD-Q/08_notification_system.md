Designing a **Notification System** is a classic High-Level Design (HLD) question often asked in system design interviews. Here’s a structured way to approach it:

---

## 🚧 Problem Statement

Design a **Notification System** that:

* Sends messages (email, SMS, push) to users
* Respects **user preferences**
* Supports **retry logic**
* Handles **failures gracefully**
* Scales to millions of users and notifications

---

## 🧱 Core Requirements

### 🎯 Functional:

* Support multiple channels: Email, SMS, Push
* Retry on failure (configurable retries & backoff)
* Allow user preferences (channel type, opt-in/out)
* Deduplication (avoid spamming)
* Prioritization (e.g., critical alerts vs marketing)

### 🚫 Non-Functional:

* High throughput, low latency
* Scalable & fault-tolerant
* Reliable delivery (eventual consistency OK)
* Observability (logs, metrics, alerts)

## 🧩 Component Breakdown

### 1. **Notification Requester**

* Microservices, UI triggers, or cron jobs call the API to send a notification.

### 2. **Notification Service**

* API Gateway or service that validates input, resolves user preferences.
* Pushes messages into a **queue** after enrichment.

### 3. **Queue (e.g., Kafka/SQS/RabbitMQ)**

* Decouples sender and processor
* Enables retries, parallel processing, and scaling

### 4. **Notification Processor (Worker Service)**

* Listens to the queue
* Applies retry logic if needed
* Calls appropriate channel adapters (Email, SMS, Push)

### 5. **Channel Adapters**

* Abstract the external services like:

  * **Email**: SES, SendGrid
  * **SMS**: Twilio, Nexmo
  * **Push**: Firebase, APNs

### 6. **Retry Handler**

* Handle temporary failures
* Use exponential backoff and dead-letter queues (DLQ)
* Retry based on config (max attempts, delay intervals)

### 7. **User Preferences Service**

* Stores user-level config like:

  * Preferred channels
  * Do-not-disturb time
  * Opted-out types

## 🗃️ Data Models (Simplified)

### 📄 `NotificationRequest`

```json
{
  "user_id": "123",
  "type": "TRANSACTIONAL",
  "channels": ["email", "sms"],
  "message": {
    "title": "Your order has shipped!",
    "body": "Tracking #: 123456"
  }
}
```

### 🧾 `UserPreferences`

```json
{
  "user_id": "123",
  "email": true,
  "sms": false,
  "push": true,
  "dnd": {
    "start": "22:00",
    "end": "07:00"
  }
}
```

---

## 🛡️ Reliability Features

* **Retries**: With exponential backoff and DLQ
* **Idempotency**: Unique notification ID to avoid duplicates
* **Rate Limiting**: To avoid abuse or spamming
* **Monitoring**: Alerts, retries, failures via Prometheus, ELK, etc.

---

## 📈 Scalability Plan

* Use **Kafka or SQS** for massive scale
* Workers can scale horizontally
* Use **Redis or Memcached** to cache preferences
* Split queues by **priority** (e.g., critical vs bulk)

---

## ✅ Optional Enhancements

* **Notification Templates** with placeholders
* **Localization (i18n)** support
* **Scheduling/Delayed delivery**
* **A/B testing** for campaigns
* **Analytics Dashboard** for delivery/open rates

---

## 💬 Example Use Case

> 🔔 Send a push notification to user A at 9AM unless they opted out.
>
> * Check preferences
> * Validate DND window
> * Format message
> * Push to queue
> * Retry if Firebase fails
