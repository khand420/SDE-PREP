Great! Here's a **mock interview dialogue** for the **Rate Limiter** problem. It simulates how you'd structure your answer in a real interview, including questions, assumptions, and explanations. The interviewer will ask follow-up questions, and you’ll respond with the structured approach we’ve talked about.

---

### **Mock Interview Dialogue:**

---

**Interviewer:**
"Alright, let’s say you’re working at a company that provides an API, and you need to design a rate limiter to prevent abuse. How would you go about designing this system?"

---

**You:**
"Got it! To clarify, could you help me with a few details before I dive into the design? Specifically:

1. **Is the rate limit applied per user, per IP address, or globally for all users?**
2. **Do we need to handle burst traffic? For example, can a user send 100 requests in a second, or should it be evenly distributed?**
3. \*\*What’s the rate limit? For example, 100 requests per minute, 1000 per hour, or some other configuration?"

---

**Interviewer:**
"Good questions! Let's say the rate limit is 100 requests per minute per user. We’ll allow a burst of traffic, but it should eventually throttle down to that rate. It’s per user, not global."

---

**You:**
"Alright, that helps a lot! I’ll assume we need to design a system that handles **100 requests per minute per user**, and the system needs to handle **millions of users**. We’ll aim for **scalability**, and the rate limiting should **smooth out bursts** without allowing abuse."

---

**Interviewer:**
"Sounds good. Now, how would you go about designing this?"

---

**You:**
"Great! I’ll walk through the design in two parts: **High-Level Design** (HLD) first, followed by **Low-Level Design** (LLD).

### **HLD**:

At a high level, we need a **rate limiting service** that will track the number of requests each user has made in a given time period (like a minute). We also need to check each incoming request to decide whether it should be allowed or blocked.

We can break it down into a few components:

1. **API Gateway / Rate Limiter Service**: This service will be placed in front of the API to intercept requests and apply the rate-limiting logic.
2. **Storage**: We’ll need a way to store each user’s request count and reset it periodically. For this, I recommend using **Redis** because of its **speed and scalability**.
3. **Load Balancer**: If the system scales, we'll use a load balancer to distribute requests to multiple instances of the rate limiter.

To handle the rate limiting logic, we’ll use a **Token Bucket** or **Sliding Window** approach to allow bursts of traffic while ensuring we don’t exceed the limit of 100 requests per minute.

---

**Interviewer:**
"Interesting! Can you briefly explain the **Token Bucket** approach and why you chose that over something like a **Fixed Window Counter**?"

---

**You:**
"Sure! The **Fixed Window Counter** approach has a drawback: at the start of a new window, a user could send 100 requests all at once, which isn’t ideal in terms of fairness.

On the other hand, the **Token Bucket** algorithm allows for bursts up to the maximum limit but doesn’t let the user exceed it. Tokens are refilled at a fixed rate (say 100 tokens per minute). When a user sends a request, they consume a token. If no tokens are available, the request is blocked. This approach gives us the **flexibility to handle bursts** while maintaining fairness.

I chose the **Token Bucket** over other approaches because it smooths out traffic spikes and can be easily implemented with **Redis** for fast access and high availability."

---

**Interviewer:**
"That makes sense. How would you implement this in more detail? Can you walk through the **Low-Level Design (LLD)**?"

---

**You:**
"Absolutely. For the **Low-Level Design**:

* Each user will have a unique Redis key: `"rate:<user_id>"`.
* The value will store the **remaining tokens** (or the number of requests they’ve used within the window), and **TTL (Time To Live)** to automatically reset their token count once the time window expires.
* Redis will handle the rate-limiting logic using an **atomic Lua script** to ensure that token updates are done atomically to avoid race conditions.

#### Here’s how the process works:

1. **Token Refill**: We’ll refill the user’s token bucket at a fixed rate, say 1 token per second. This can be done using Redis’ **TTL** feature for keys.
2. **Request Handling**:

   * When a request comes in, we first check if the user has tokens available.
   * If they do, we decrement the token count and allow the request.
   * If no tokens are available, we block the request and return a **429 Too Many Requests** response.

Let me quickly illustrate the logic in code:

```python
import redis
from time import time

class TokenBucketRateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, redis_client, rate_limit, window_size):
        self.redis = redis_client
        self.rate_limit = rate_limit  # 100 requests per minute
        self.window_size = window_size  # 60 seconds

    def allow_request(self, user_id):
        key = f"rate:{user_id}"
        current_time = int(time())
        
        # Lua script to handle token decrement and refill atomically
        script = """
        local tokens = redis.call('get', KEYS[1])
        if tokens == false then
            redis.call('set', KEYS[1], ARGV[1], 'EX', ARGV[2])
            return ARGV[1]
        end
        if tonumber(tokens) > 0 then
            redis.call('decr', KEYS[1])
            return 1
        else
            return 0
        end
        """
        
        result = self.redis.eval(script, 1, key, self.rate_limit, self.window_size)
        
        if result == 1:
            return True  # Allow request
        else:
            return False  # Deny request
```

---

**Interviewer:**
"Nice! I see how the refill and decrement work. But what happens if there are millions of users? Can Redis handle that scale?"

---

**You:**
"Good question! Redis is great for handling high throughput, but for **millions of users**, we’d want to consider a few things:

1. **Sharding**: We could **shard** Redis keys across multiple Redis instances to balance the load, using **consistent hashing** based on `user_id` to distribute users evenly.
2. **Caching**: For users who haven’t made any requests recently, we can cache their token count in memory, which would reduce the load on Redis.
3. **Distributed Rate Limiting**: If Redis is down or if we need more fault tolerance, we can use **eventual consistency** and fall back to a less strict method (e.g., storing counts locally in a distributed database temporarily).

For really high scale, we could move rate-limiting logic closer to the user, such as implementing it at the **CDN edge** or in the **API Gateway** layer, to reduce backend load."

---

**Interviewer:**
"That’s a solid design. What edge cases would you handle for a rate limiter?"

---

**You:**
"Here are a few edge cases to consider:

1. **Clock Skew**: If users are distributed across different servers, clock skew could cause issues. We can handle this by syncing time using a **distributed time protocol** or by using **tolerances**.
2. **Stale Data**: If a user’s request count is outdated or expired in Redis, we need to reset it, which Redis TTL handles, but we also need to ensure that the data doesn’t stay too long.
3. **Multiple Instances**: In a multi-instance setup, we must ensure that Redis handles concurrent requests correctly and prevents race conditions using Lua scripts or atomic operations.
4. **User IP Spoofing**: Rate limiting based on user IP might allow for abuse. To prevent this, we might need more sophisticated user identification beyond IP addresses, like **OAuth tokens** or **API keys**."

---

**Interviewer:**
"Awesome! It looks like you’ve considered the key points. Thanks for walking me through that!"

---

**You:**
"Thank you! If you’d like, I can code a simple in-memory version or dive deeper into some optimizations."

---

**Interviewer:**
"Not necessary right now, but great job. Thanks for your thorough explanation."

---

### **Key Takeaways for Your Answer**:

1. **Start with clarifying questions** to fully understand the requirements.
2. **Present your design in a structured manner** (HLD -> LLD).
3. **Explain trade-offs and optimizations** clearly (e.g., Redis for scaling).
4. **Handle edge cases and potential issues** like clock skew, stale data, and high scale.

I hope this mock dialogue helps you prepare for the real interview! Feel free to practice your responses and try to keep them **clear**, **concise**, and **structured**. Let me know if you’d like more practice scenarios or need further details!







Great! You're referring to a common **system design question** asked in SDE interviews, especially for SDE II and above:
👉 **“Design a Rate Limiter”**

---

### 🔧 What Interviewers Want to See

* **LLD (Low-Level Design):** Core logic, class structure, concurrency
* **HLD (High-Level Design):** Scalable architecture, distribution, API limits
* **Trade-offs:** Time/space complexity, sliding window vs token bucket
* **Clarity of thought:** How you handle scale and edge cases

---

## ✅ Problem Statement

> **Design a rate limiter that controls the number of API requests a client can make in a given time window.**

For example:

* Limit: 100 requests per minute per user
* Reject requests that exceed this limit
* Allow burst traffic handling in some variations

---

## 💡 Design Approaches

### 🔹 1. **Fixed Window Counter**

* Keep a counter for each user for each time window (e.g., minute)
* Reset counter every window

**Pros:** Simple
**Cons:** Traffic bursts allowed at window edges (e.g., 100 requests at 00:59 and again at 01:00)

---

### 🔹 2. **Sliding Window Log**

* Maintain a **timestamp log** of each request per user
* On each request: remove outdated timestamps, check the size of log

```python
class SlidingWindowRateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, limit, interval):
        self.limit = limit
        self.interval = interval  # seconds
        self.user_logs = defaultdict(deque)

    def allow_request(self, user_id, timestamp):
        log = self.user_logs[user_id]
        while log and timestamp - log[0] > self.interval:
            log.popleft()
        if len(log) < self.limit:
            log.append(timestamp)
            return True
        return False
```

**Pros:** Accurate
**Cons:** High memory and CPU usage

---

### 🔹 3. **Sliding Window Counter (Approximation)**

* Break time into smaller buckets (e.g., 6 buckets of 10s each for a 1 min window)
* Sum recent bucket counts

**Pros:** Balance of accuracy & performance
**Cons:** More complex to implement

---

### 🔹 4. **Token Bucket / Leaky Bucket**

* **Token Bucket:** Tokens are added at a fixed rate, request takes a token
* **Leaky Bucket:** Requests enter a queue, processed at a fixed rate

Used by APIs like Stripe, Cloudflare

**Pros:** Smooths traffic spikes
**Cons:** Complex but great for distributed systems

---

## 🏗️ HLD – Scalable Architecture

**Components:**

* API Gateway or Rate Limiter Service (stateless or with cache)
* Redis or in-memory store for token counts
* Load Balancer (if distributed)

**For distributed rate limiting:**

* Use Redis with Lua scripts to make atomic updates
* Redis key = `"rate:<user_id>"`, value = token count + TTL

---

## 🎯 Interview Talk Track

1. Clarify:

   * Per-user or global?
   * What is the rate (requests/sec)?
   * Is burstiness allowed?

2. Pick a strategy:

   * Small scale → sliding window log
   * High throughput → token bucket + Redis

3. Talk through:

   * Time complexity (e.g., O(1) for token bucket)
   * Memory trade-offs
   * Distributed locking if needed

4. Code a core version if asked (usually for LLD)

---

## ⚠️ Edge Cases to Handle

* Clock skew
* Multiple instances syncing state
* Abuse detection (retry floods)
* Expired entries cleanup

## 🗣️ Example Talk-Through for "Design a Rate Limiter"

You say this **step-by-step during the interview**:

---

### 🧩 1. **Ask Clarifying Questions**

> “Is the rate limit applied per user, per IP, or globally?”
>
> “Do we allow burst traffic or should we smooth the request rate?”
>
> “What’s the rate limit? e.g., 100 reqs/min? Is it configurable?”

---

### 🧠 2. **Define Assumptions**

> “Let’s assume the rate limit is 100 requests per minute, per user. Burst is not allowed. It should scale for millions of users.”

---

### 🏗️ 3. **High-Level Design**

> “We’ll need a component that intercepts every API request, checks whether it should be allowed or blocked based on rate limiting logic.”

Draw or describe:

* API Gateway or Middleware
* Rate Limiter (central or local)
* Storage (in-memory, Redis, etc.)

---

### 🔍 4. **Choose & Explain Algorithm**

> “There are a few ways to implement rate limiting. For simplicity, I’ll compare three options and then choose one.”

Then briefly:

* **Fixed Window Counter**: Simple, but inaccurate at edges
* **Sliding Window Log**: Accurate, but memory-intensive
* **Token Bucket**: Smooth flow, supports bursts, scalable

> “For a production system, I’d go with **Token Bucket using Redis**, since it's scalable and offers consistent throttling.”

---

### 🧪 5. **Low-Level Design (LLD)**

You now describe or write:

* Token refill logic
* How requests consume tokens
* How you’d use Redis keys to track token counts per user

> “Each user has a Redis key like `rate:<user_id>`. Tokens refill at a fixed rate using Redis TTL, and each request tries to decrement the token count using an atomic Lua script.”

---

### ⚖️ 6. **Trade-offs & Optimization**

> “We use Redis for fast access, but it can become a bottleneck. For extreme scale, we could shard keys, use local caching, or run rate limiting on the edge (CDN).”

---

### ⚠️ 7. **Handle Edge Cases**

> “We also need to consider clock skew in distributed setups, Redis eviction policies, and how to clean up stale keys for inactive users.”

---

### ✨ Bonus: If asked to code

Offer:

> “I can implement a basic in-memory sliding window log or token bucket in Python or Java.”
