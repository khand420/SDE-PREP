If you're asked **"Design a Parking Lot System"** in an interview, here's how you can **structure your answer step-by-step** — clearly and confidently:

---

### ✅ Step 1: Clarify Requirements

Start by asking clarifying questions:

> “Before jumping in, I'd like to clarify:
> – What types of vehicles do we support (bike, car, truck)?
> – Are there different parking spot types?
> – Should we support multiple floors?
> – Is billing or entry/exit management part of the scope?”

This shows **you think before designing** — very important in LLD interviews.

### 🧱 Step 2: Define Key Components

Now describe your class-based breakdown. Keep it simple and speak out loud:

> “At a high level, I’ll have the following classes:

* `ParkingLot`: contains multiple levels
* `Level`: holds parking spots
* `ParkingSpot`: can be occupied or free
* `Vehicle`: has plate number and type
* `Ticket`: tracks entry time and assigned spot
* `ParkingManager`: handles assigning spots, generating tickets, and calculating fees”

✅ Keep it short — don’t over-engineer in the first go.

### ⚙️ Step 3: Talk Through Key Flows

Use basic scenarios like:

> “Let’s walk through a vehicle entry:

1. Vehicle arrives
2. `ParkingManager` finds a free spot
3. A `Ticket` is generated with timestamp and spot
4. On exit, fee is calculated from ticket info”

Use **real-world steps** — interviewers appreciate simplicity.

### 🧠 Step 4: Discuss OOP Concepts

> “To keep the design modular, I’ll use:
> – **Strategy Pattern** for flexible billing logic
> – **Singleton** for the ParkingLot instance
> – Optionally a **Factory** to create different spot types”

---

### 🚀 Step 5: Extendability

End with future features:

> “This can be extended to support:
> – Real-time spot availability with sensors
> – Mobile booking
> – Entry via license plate scanning”

---

### ✅ Final Tip:

Be **structured**, **clear**, and **pragmatic**. Don’t jump into code unless asked.
Speak as if you're **walking a teammate through the design**.
