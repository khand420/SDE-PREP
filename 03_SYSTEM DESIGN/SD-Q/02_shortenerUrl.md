Great — *“Design a URL Shortener”* is one of the most frequently asked system design questions, and it’s perfect for showcasing your **clarity of thinking, knowledge of design patterns, and trade-off handling.**

Here’s how you can answer it **step-by-step** in an interview to **impress at SD3 level**:

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Answer: **Design a URL Shortener (like Bitly)**

---

### ✅ Step 1: Clarify Requirements

> “Let me confirm the requirements before I jump in. Do we want a basic URL shortener or something production-grade like Bitly?”

#### 📌 Functional:

* Convert long URLs to short ones
* Redirect short URL to original URL
* Track number of visits (optional)
* Expiry for links (optional)
* Custom aliases (optional)

#### 📌 Non-functional:

* High availability
* Low latency
* Horizontally scalable
* Strong consistency on reads

---

### ✅ Step 2: High-Level Overview

> “At a high level, I’ll break the system into services: URL generation, storage, and redirection. I’ll ensure we support scalability and fast redirection.”

#### 🧱 Key Components:

1. **API Service** (POST `/shorten`, GET `/resolve`)
2. **ID Generator** (unique short codes)
3. **Database** (store long ↔ short URL)
4. **Cache Layer** (fast redirection)
5. **Analytics Service** (optional)
6. **Redirection Layer** (serves billions of reads)

---

### ✅ Step 3: API Design

#### ➕ Create Short URL

```
POST /shorten
{
   "original_url": "https://example.com/long/path",
   "custom_alias": "promo2025" (optional),
   "expire_in_days": 30 (optional)
}
→ Response: { "short_url": "https://sho.rt/abc123" }
```

#### 🔁 Redirect

```
GET /abc123 → 302 Redirect to original URL
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Short Code Generation

> “There are multiple ways to generate a short code. I’d prefer a **base62-encoded unique ID** or **hashing**.”

#### 🔢 Options:

1. **Auto-increment ID + Base62 encoding**
2. **MD5/SHA256 hash of original URL**
3. **Random 6-8 char code (with collision check)**

#### Example:

```python
def encode(num):
    base62_chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"
    code = ""
    while num > 0:
        code = base62_chars[num % 62] + code
        num //= 62
    return code
```

> "To avoid race conditions, I could use a separate ID generation service (like Twitter Snowflake or Redis atomic counters)."

### ✅ Step 5: Database Design

#### 🔷 Table: `url_mapping`

| short\_code | long\_url                                                                | created\_at | expires\_at | clicks |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| abc123      | [https://example.com/very-long-link](https://example.com/very-long-link) | 2025-06-25  | 2025-07-25  | 1032   |

* **Primary key:** short\_code
* **Index:** long\_url (for deduplication)

> “I’d use a relational DB for consistency (PostgreSQL), and Redis/Memcached for fast lookup.”

---

### ✅ Step 6: Redirection Flow

> “Most traffic is reads (GET), so I’d optimize redirection path:”

1. Request hits CDN (Cloudflare)
2. If cache miss → check Redis
3. If Redis miss → check DB
4. Cache DB result in Redis for future

> “I’d use a 302 (temporary) redirect for non-permanent links.”

---

### ✅ Step 7: Scalability & Performance

| Problem            | Solution                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Hot keys / traffic | Use consistent hashing to distribute |
| DB bottlenecks     | Read replicas / sharded DB           |
| Cache eviction     | Use LRU with TTL                     |
| Collisions         | Check short\_code before insert      |
| Custom aliases     | Store in a separate unique index     |

---

### ✅ Step 8: Advanced Features (Only if Time Allows)

* Custom aliases (conflict checking)
* Expiry handling with background jobs
* Analytics: track location, user-agent, time
* Abuse/spam detection
* QR code generation

---

### ✅ Step 9: Summary (Close Strong)

> “To summarize: I’ve designed a scalable, consistent, and performant URL shortening service with base62 encoding, Redis cache for redirection speed, a relational DB for storage, and optional support for analytics and custom aliases. It’s horizontally scalable and can serve millions of reads per day with low latency.”

---

### Bonus Tip:

If you're asked to scale to **1 billion requests/day**:

* Use **CDN caching**
* Move redirection logic to edge
* Use **Bloom Filters** to avoid unnecessary DB hits
* **Partition the database** by short\_code prefix

   - **Usage**: Provides similar output sizes as SHA-2 (e.g., SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512) and is suitable for applications requiring high security.

5. **SHA-KE**
   - **Description**: A variant of SHA-3 that allows for variable-length output.
   - **Usage**: Useful in applications where different hash sizes are needed, providing flexibility.

### Summary

- **SHA-0**: Withdrawn due to security flaws.
