Q How would you prioritize between reliability and performance?


Prioritizing between **reliability** and **performance** depends on the **context of the system**, its **users**, and **business goals**. But here's a structured way to think about it:

---

## âœ… Definitions First

* **Reliability**:
  The systemâ€™s ability to function **consistently and correctly** over time without failures.

* **Performance**:
  How **fast or efficient** the system is â€” e.g., response time, throughput, resource usage.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ General Principle

> **"Make it work first (reliability), then make it fast (performance)."**

---

## ðŸ§  When to Prioritize **Reliability** Over Performance

Prioritize **reliability** when:

* You're building **critical systems** (finance, healthcare, infrastructure).
* Data loss, corruption, or errors are unacceptable.
* The cost of downtime is high.
* SLAs require high availability (e.g., 99.99% uptime).
* You're in early development or MVP â€” correctness matters more than speed.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
A banking API **must always return accurate balances** â€” even if it's slightly slower.

## âš¡ When to Prioritize **Performance** Over Reliability

Prioritize **performance** when:

* System is already **highly reliable** and youâ€™re optimizing UX.
* **Real-time** processing is needed (e.g., gaming, trading apps).
* You're handling **high-volume traffic** and latency is critical.
* Failures are tolerable or mitigated (e.g., retries, fallbacks).
* You're optimizing cost (faster processing = fewer resources).

ðŸ“Œ Example:
A search engine must return results in **under 100ms** to keep users engaged â€” even if 0.1% of results occasionally timeout.

## âœ… Smart Balance: Reliability *and* Performance

You usually want to balance both:

| Feature           | Goal                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| Retry logic       | Improve reliability     |
| Caching           | Improve performance     |
| Rate limiting     | Improve reliability     |
| Load balancing    | Improve both            |
| Graceful fallback | Improve user experience |

## ðŸ§ª Interview Tip

> "I'd prioritize **reliability** first â€” users expect systems to work correctly. Once the system is dependable, Iâ€™d profile and optimize for performance where it matters most."

Would you like a system-specific example (like API, web app, or database)?
