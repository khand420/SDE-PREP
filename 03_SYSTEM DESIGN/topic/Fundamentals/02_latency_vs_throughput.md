Great question â€” **latency** and **throughput** are two fundamental performance metrics in computing and networking, but they measure **very different things**.

## ðŸš¦ **Latency vs. Throughput** â€“ Key Differences

| Feature                  | **Latency**                                     | **Throughput**                                |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**           | Time taken to complete one operation or request | Amount of data/work done per unit of time     |
| **Measured in**          | Time (e.g. milliseconds, seconds)               | Rate (e.g. requests/second, MB/s)             |
| **Focuses on**           | **Speed** of a single task                      | **Capacity** of the system                    |
| **Lower is better?**     | âœ… Yes                                           | âœ… No, **higher** is better                    |
| **Example (Real World)** | How fast one car passes through a toll booth    | How many cars pass through the toll in 1 hour |

## ðŸ§  Examples to Understand:

### âœ… 1. **Network Example**:

* **Latency**: Time it takes for a message to travel from your computer to a server (say 100ms).
* **Throughput**: How much data you can send per second (say 10 MB/s).

### âœ… 2. **API Server Example**:

* **Latency**: How long it takes to process a single API request (e.g. 200ms).
* **Throughput**: How many API requests the server can handle per second (e.g. 1000 req/sec).

## ðŸ“Œ Quick Analogy:

### Think of a Water Pipe:

* **Latency** = Time for the **first drop** to come out after you open the tap.
* **Throughput** = **How much water** flows per minute.

## âœ… When You Care About Each:

| Situation                            | What Matters Most?                |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Real-time apps (chat, games)         | **Latency**                       |
| File transfer, bulk processing       | **Throughput**                    |
| User-facing APIs (UX responsiveness) | Both â€” but start with **latency** |
| System capacity planning             | **Throughput**                    |
