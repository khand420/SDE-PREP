In a **distributed system**, reliability, availability, and fault tolerance are key attributes that define how robust and resilient the system is, especially when dealing with failures, high loads, or unexpected behavior.

Here’s a clear breakdown of each:

---

### 🔁 **1. Reliability**

**Definition**:
**Reliability** is the ability of a system to perform its intended function **consistently and correctly** over time, without failure.

**Key Idea**: The system does what it's supposed to do, every time.

**Example**:
If a distributed database is reliable, then once it confirms a write operation, that data will not be lost or corrupted—even if some nodes go down later.

**Common techniques**:

* Data replication
* Persistent storage
* Checksums / error detection

---

### 🟢 **2. Availability**

**Definition**:
**Availability** refers to the system’s ability to remain **accessible and responsive** to users **at all times**, even during partial failures.

**Key Idea**: The system is up and serving requests.

**Example**:
If a web application is available, users can still access it even if one of the backend servers crashes.

**Common techniques**:

* Load balancing
* Failover mechanisms
* Redundant services

**Note**: A system can be **available but not reliable** — e.g., it responds to requests but returns wrong or stale data.

---

### 🛡️ **3. Fault Tolerance**

**Definition**:
**Fault tolerance** is the system’s ability to **continue functioning correctly** even when part of the system fails.

**Key Idea**: Something broke, but the system still works.

**Example**:
In a distributed file system, if one node fails, the system reroutes requests to replicas on other nodes without any downtime.

**Common techniques**:

* Redundancy
* Consensus algorithms (e.g., Paxos, Raft)
* Retry and fallback strategies

| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Reliability**     | Correctness over time          | Might stop working, but never corrupts data | Do the right thing, always        |
| **Availability**    | Uptime and responsiveness      | Keeps responding even if degraded           | Stay online and serve users       |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Functionality despite failures | Absorbs and hides failures                  | Continue operating under problems |
