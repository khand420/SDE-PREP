Great question ‚Äî and it's a **common point of confusion** in interviews.

### ‚ùì **Is SOLID a Design Pattern?**

**No**, **SOLID is *not* a design pattern**.

üîπ **SOLID** is a set of **five design principles** intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

üîπ **Design Patterns** (like Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.) are **standard solutions to common design problems**, often built *using* SOLID principles.

## üß± **SOLID Explained (Principles, Not Patterns)**

| Principle | Full Name                       | Purpose                                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S**     | Single Responsibility Principle | A class should have one reason to change.                                    |
| **O**     | Open/Closed Principle           | Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. |
| **L**     | Liskov Substitution Principle   | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.                         |
| **I**     | Interface Segregation Principle | Clients shouldn't be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.          |
| **D**     | Dependency Inversion Principle  | Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.                                  |

## üîÑ **Relationship Between SOLID and Design Patterns**

| Principle | Pattern That Demonstrates It  |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| SRP       | MVC, DAO pattern              |
| OCP       | Strategy, Decorator           |
| LSP       | Template Method, Inheritance  |
| ISP       | Role Interface pattern        |
| DIP       | Dependency Injection, Factory |

### ‚úÖ Summary

* üîπ **SOLID = Design Principles** (how to design)
* üîπ **Design Patterns = Design Solutions** (how to implement)

Would you like an example of how a pattern follows one of the SOLID principles?
