### 1. **What are Python's key features?**

Python is known for its simplicity and readability. Here are some of its key features:

* **Simple and Easy to Learn**: Python syntax is clean and easy to understand, making it a great choice for beginners.
* **Interpreted Language**: Python is an interpreted language, meaning it executes code line-by-line, which helps with debugging.
* **Dynamically Typed**: You don't need to declare variable types explicitly; Python automatically assigns the type at runtime.
* **Cross-platform**: Python code can run on any platform that has a Python interpreter (Windows, MacOS, Linux).
* **Large Standard Library**: Python comes with a huge standard library that provides modules and packages to perform a variety of tasks like file operations, regular expressions, and more.
* **Object-Oriented and Functional**: Supports object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming paradigms.
* **Extensive Support for Libraries**: There are numerous third-party libraries available for data analysis (Pandas, NumPy), machine learning (TensorFlow, scikit-learn), web development (Django, Flask), etc.
* **Community Support**: Python has an active community with a wealth of resources, tutorials, and forums.

### 2. **What is the difference between `list`, `tuple`, `set`, and `dict`?**

| Data Structure | Mutable | Order                      | Duplicates | Description                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------- | -------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **List**       | Yes     | Ordered (from Python 3.7+) | Yes        | A collection of ordered elements. Lists are indexed, mutable, and allow duplicates.                                    |
| **Tuple**      | No      | Ordered                    | Yes        | Similar to lists but immutable. Tuples are typically used for fixed collections of items.                              |
| **Set**        | Yes     | Unordered                  | No         | A collection of unique elements without any indexing. Sets are used when membership tests and uniqueness are required. |
| **Dict**       | Yes     | Ordered (from Python 3.7+) | No         | A collection of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique, but values can be duplicated.                                    |

#### Example:

```python
# List
my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3]
# Tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# Set
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
# Dictionary
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
```

---

### 3. **What are *mutable* and *immutable* types in Python?**

* **Mutable Types**: Objects that can be modified after creation. Examples: lists, sets, dictionaries.

  * Example:

    ```python
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    my_list[0] = 10  # List is mutable
    print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3]
    ```

* **Immutable Types**: Objects that cannot be modified after creation. Examples: strings, tuples, integers.

  * Example:

    ```python
    my_string = "hello"
    my_string[0] = "H"  # This will raise a TypeError
    ```

---

### 4. **What is the difference between `is` and `==`?**

* **`==` (Equality Operator)**: Checks if the **values** of two objects are equal.
* **`is` (Identity Operator)**: Checks if two variables **refer to the same object** in memory (i.e., have the same memory address).

#### Example:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
c = a

print(a == b)  # True: values are equal
print(a is b)  # False: different objects in memory
print(a is c)  # True: both refer to the same object
```

### 5. **What are *Python data types*?**

Python provides several built-in data types:

* **Numeric Types**: `int`, `float`, `complex`
* **Sequence Types**: `str`, `list`, `tuple`
* **Set Types**: `set`, `frozenset`
* **Mapping Type**: `dict`
* **Boolean Type**: `bool`
* **Binary Types**: `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`
* **None Type**: `None` (Represents absence of a value)

#### Example:

```python
a = 5        # int
b = 3.14     # float
c = "hello"  # str
d = [1, 2, 3]  # list
```

---

### 6. **Explain list comprehensions with an example.**

List comprehension is a concise way to create lists. It combines a for-loop with the list creation, making the code more readable and compact.

**Syntax**: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`

#### Example:

```python
# Create a list of squares for numbers from 0 to 4
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

---

### 7. **What are `*args` and `**kwargs`?**

* **`*args`**: Used to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments to a function. `args` is a tuple.

  Example:

  ```python
  def func(*args):
      for arg in args:
          print(arg)
  func(1, 2, 3)  # Output: 1 2 3
  ```

* **`**kwargs`**: Used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. `kwargs` is a dictionary.

  Example:

  ```python
  def func(**kwargs):
      for key, value in kwargs.items():
          print(key, value)
  func(a=1, b=2)  # Output: a 1 \n b 2
  ```

---

### 8. **What is a Python module vs a package?**

* **Module**: A Python file containing Python code (functions, classes, variables). A module can be imported and used in other Python programs.

  Example: `math.py` is a module.

  ```python
  import math
  print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
  ```

* **Package**: A collection of Python modules organized in directories with an `__init__.py` file, allowing for hierarchical structuring of the code.

  Example: `my_package` can contain multiple modules like `module1.py`, `module2.py`.

---

### 9. **How does Python manage memory?**

Python manages memory through:

* **Reference Counting**: Keeps track of the number of references pointing to an object. When the reference count becomes zero, the object is deleted.
* **Garbage Collection**: Python uses a garbage collector to identify and clean up cyclic references (objects that reference each other but are no longer needed).

#### Example:

```python
import sys
a = [1, 2, 3]
print(sys.getrefcount(a))  # Shows reference count of the object
```

---

### 10. **What is PEP8 and why is it important?**

**PEP8** (Python Enhancement Proposal 8) is the style guide for Python code. It defines how to format Python code for maximum readability. Adhering to PEP8 makes code easier to read and maintain, and ensures consistency across Python projects.

**Key Guidelines**:

* **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
* **Line Length**: Limit all lines to 79 characters.
* **Naming Conventions**: Use snake\_case for variables and function names, and CapitalizedWords for class names.
* **Blank Lines**: Use blank lines to separate functions and classes.

#### Example:

```python
def calculate_area(radius):
    pi = 3.14159
    return pi * radius ** 2
```
