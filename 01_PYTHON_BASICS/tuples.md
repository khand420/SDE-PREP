   ```

3. **How do you concatenate two tuples?**
   ```python
   tuple1 = (1, 2)
   tuple2 = (3, 4)
   concatenated = tuple1 + tuple2  # (1, 2, 3, 4)
   ```

4. **How can you repeat elements in a tuple?**
   ```python
   repeated = (1, 2) * 3  # (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)
   ```

5. **What is tuple unpacking, and how is it used?**
   ```python
   a, b = (10, 20)  # a = 10, b = 20
   ```

6. **How do you find the length of a tuple?**
   ```python
   length = len((1, 2, 3, 4))  # 4
   ```

7. **How can you check if an element exists in a tuple?**
   ```python

   my_tuple = tuple(my_list)  # (1, 2, 3)
   ```

10. **What is the difference between a tuple and a list?**
    - Tuples are immutable (cannot be changed), while lists are mutable (can be modified).

    ```

18. **How can you use the `*` operator for unpacking tuples?**
