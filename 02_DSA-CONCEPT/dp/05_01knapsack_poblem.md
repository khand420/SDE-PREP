The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science and operations research. It can be described as follows:

### Problem Statement
You are given:

- A set of items, each with a weight and a value.
- A knapsack with a maximum weight capacity.

The goal is to determine the maximum value that can be put in the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity. Each item can either be included in the knapsack (1) or excluded (0), hence the name "0/1 Knapsack."

### Mathematical Formulation

Let:
- \( n \) = number of items
- \( w[i] \) = weight of item \( i \)
- \( v[i] \) = value of item \( i \)
- \( W \) = maximum weight capacity of the knapsack

The objective is to maximize the total value:

\[
\text{Maximize} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{n} v[i] \cdot x[i]
\]

Subject to the constraint:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} w[i] \cdot x[i] \leq W
\]

Where \( x[i] \) is either 0 or 1 (0 if item \( i \) is not included, 1 if it is included).

### Dynamic Programming Approach

1. **Create a DP table:** Create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum value that can be obtained with the first \( i \) items and a maximum weight \( j \).

2. **Base Case:** If there are no items or the capacity is 0, then the maximum value is 0.

3. **Fill the DP table:**
   - If the weight of the current item is less than or equal to the current capacity, you have two choices:
     - Include the item: `value = v[i-1] + dp[i-1][j-w[i-1]]`
     - Exclude the item: `value = dp[i-1][j]`
   - Otherwise, exclude the item: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`

4. **Result:** The value at `dp[n][W]` will be the maximum value that can be obtained.

### Example

Consider the following items:

- Item 1: weight = 1, value = 1
- Item 2: weight = 2, value = 6
- Item 3: weight = 3, value = 10
- Item 4: weight = 5, value = 16

And a knapsack capacity \( W = 7 \).

You would fill the DP table and find the maximum value that can be obtained.
