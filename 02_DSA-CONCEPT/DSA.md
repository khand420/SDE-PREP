3. **Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters**
   - Given a string, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most K distinct characters.

4. **Anagrams in a String**
   - Given a string and a pattern, find all the start indices of the pattern's anagrams in the string.

5. **Minimum Window Substring**
   - Given two strings, S and T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T.

6. **Count Occurrences of Anagrams**
   - Given a string and a pattern, count the occurrences of the pattern's anagrams in the string.
